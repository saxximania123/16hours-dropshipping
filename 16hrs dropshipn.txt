this is the only Drop Shipping course you'll ever need over the last 8 years I made over $10 million doing this and I'm
0:07
going to teach you everything I know you'll see me build a store live put my strategies into action and work to make
0:14
it profitable so that you could learn and follow along in real time this is your complete guide to getting actual
0:20
results not just starting but growing into consistent sales so let's waste no time and jump right to it starting with
0:27
the first step product research finding a winning product to sell product research is the most important part when
0:33
you're running your Drop Shipping business it's more important than the way that your store looks it's more important than your product page and
0:40
your description and titles now don't get me wrong all those things are important but if you do not find the
0:45
right products to sell and know how to Target the Right audience with that product everything else all of the time
0:51
all of the budget that you put on everything else will simply go to waste and I don't want you to get burned out
0:56
right from the start so we are going to do product research the right way and we're going to start with that we're not
1:01
going to start creating our stores and we're not going to move down in that direction until we find the right
1:07
products to sell and then we're going to create everything around those products so let's go ahead and get started with
1:12
product research the most important part when we're starting to create our Drop Shipping businesses so let's start with
1:18
the basics what makes a winning Drop Shipping product first and foremost it needs to have some kind of a wow factor
1:24
or solve a unique and obvious problem that people are having now it could be either or and it can can also be both
1:30
but you want it to have at least one of these conditions next you want to make sure that the product is actually in
1:35
demand you want to see that the product has recent engagement in the ad copies all of which I'm going to show you soon
1:41
how to get to those products how to get to the ad copies and how to do all of this research and you can also check out
1:47
places like Google Trends and write the name or the category of that product and see if there's a sege in people who are
1:52
searching for that type of product next we want to make sure that our product sells for over $30 so we're going to
1:57
check out our competitors we're going to see how much they're selling it for and the reason that we want it to be sold for over $30 is because we do not want
2:03
to compete with products that cost around $10 to purchase them because there simply isn't much of a profit
2:08
margin in those products and we also don't want to go too high because it's easier to make sales on cheaper products
2:14
rather than trying to sell $150 $300 products right from the bat and that is called high ticket products we can still
2:20
sell them but they usually sell slower than products that sell for around 3040 to $50 now another thing that I see a
2:26
lot of people getting stuck at when they're doing their product research is is this product saturated and can I even
2:32
sell this product because I already see other competitors selling them so the answer to that is there is no such thing
2:38
as product saturation and I have seen this on my stores time and time again product saturation only applies to the
2:45
way a product is being sold not the product itself and I'm going to show you some really nice examples of that soon
2:51
so I'm going to show you some winning products now that have all the criteria of what makes a winning product then
2:56
we're going to go over the best Drop Shipping niches so you'll know what categories are the best to dive into then we're going to jump into the best
3:03
product research methods and I'm going to show you how to do each and every one of them then I'm going to hook you up with some resources some tools that will
3:09
help you with your product research a few more tips then we're going to find winning products live I'm going to find
3:15
products as I record this video and those are the products that I'm going to create a store around and sell them so
3:20
that you all can see step by step how it's done the right way and then you can do the same for your drop shipping
3:26
stores so the first product is an ice air conditioning portable fan so I'm going to open up three competitors three
3:33
sellers who are selling this product right now and it's going really well for all of them and so I want you guys to
3:39
look carefully and see what's going on here so here is the first competitor selling this ice air condition portable
3:46
fan so they made a Tik Tok video and it's not even a sponsored video this is an organic video that they uploaded to
3:52
Tik Tok and it simply went crazy viral for them same things that I'm going to also do in this video and show you how
3:57
but I want you to see what I mean when I say that there is no such thing as product saturation just the way that a
4:02
product is sold on the market so this competitor right here simply ordered the product to their address and they shot a
4:09
video and it simply went viral so here is that video it's 9 seconds long it's
4:14
got almost 127,000 likes it's got over 5 million video views 1,366 comments
4:21
almost 20,000 saves and over 9,600 shares so very crazy here's the video
4:27
let's check it out and then compare it with the other people who are selling this product I'm so happy I got this IC
4:33
Mist fan now my skin is hydrated and my home is
4:39
cold so 9 seconds straight to the point text on screen just as we begin the
4:45
video and we see the product in action so there is no slow unboxing here there
4:50
is no hey check out these 10,1 features that this product has it shows you what it does right away and captures the
4:56
audience's attention oh my God they're pouring some ice into to a fan like what what is this thing and what's going to
5:02
happen and then it's I'm so happy I got this ice Miss fan okay so somebody's happy about this thing let's see what it
5:08
is and maybe we'll be happy with it too and as it goes on we can see that they finish pouring the ice they click the on
5:15
button and you see that cold Mist coming out right away so this is a job well
5:20
done straight to the point it shows that it also has a wow effect and that it's also a problem solver when it's hot
5:27
outside and inside so very cool and it hit all of the right points and how to make a good video so that is the first
5:34
seller and if I go down next to his name right here minimist fan I can see that he uploaded this video quite a long time
5:40
ago just about a year ago in in September 2023 that is when they
5:46
uploaded this video on Tik Tok so when you see this you could think wow this is actually a pretty old item I mean it was
5:53
being sold over a year ago it might not sell now because a lot of people probably know about it by now and then
5:58
that took me to the the second seller right here also on Tik Tok and he calls himself aventon limited and he just
6:05
uploaded this video just about a month ago and it's the same exact video now
6:12
I'm not saying that this is the best strategy to Simply copy and paste someone else's video without making any
6:17
changes to it whatsoever but anyway that's what this seller did and let's see if he changed anything so let's
6:23
watch the same 9-second video and you can see that this one also went viral over 101,000 videoos views that is a lot now
6:31
he may not have the same engagement amount as the first seller from last year but this guy waited a year with it
6:36
and didn't really make any changes to the creatives so let's check out the video so notice right away from the
6:43
start there is no AI speech from the text instead he wiped out the audio and added his own background
6:50
music everything else is exactly the same so he simply took that seller's
6:55
video changed the audio and uploaded the same for himself and it also ended up
7:01
working pretty good for him even though he uploaded this video about a year after that previous seller so things can
7:07
work even with products that sold last year and even if you don't put that much work into the video copy even though I
7:13
do suggest that you do and I will show you all of that further down in this video now here is the third competitor
7:19
which I want you to check out this one did go pretty viral and he uploaded it
7:24
around the same time about a month after that first seller and what he did different here which you'll see in about
7:30
a minute one of the things that was kind of weird is that he kind of put a mirror on the on the text here so you can see
7:36
that it's going from right to left instead of left to right but it says the same message I'm so happy that I got
7:42
this ice Mist fan so this is an example of people who are not going to be putting in too much work they just saw a
7:48
a seller who's doing a good job selling a product and I'm not sure why they didn't put more effort into the videos
7:53
like putting the text here from right to left just looks kind of weird but it still went super viral for him 14 5
7:59
million views 761,00 likes 2,600 comments 71,000 saves 28,000 shares
8:07
absolutely crazy and so what they do is they simply add the link to their store in the bio so people watch the video
8:13
they click on the link in the bio to get more information and then they go directly to the seller's website and purchase the product so that's one of
8:19
the greatest marketing methods that we have today we're going to touch up marketing later in this video I don't want to get into it now but I just want
8:25
you to see that product saturation does not exist it just depends on the way that the product is being sold so check
8:31
it out right here let's see the video and see what he did different besides the obvious that we can see him right
8:36
here with a green screen so it kind of looks like he's in the video and the background is the product so let's check
8:41
it out so you may have noticed that he's not speaking in English and what he did
8:47
was he just localized this video so he copied the original seller's video and
8:53
he just gave it the mirror effect right where everything is just kind of switched from you know left to right to
8:59
right to left left and he made the video in his language so he's selling it to his local audience and that's another
9:05
thing that people do when it comes to marketing when it comes to finding products to sell in their local market in the market that they understand
9:11
better that they speak the language take something that worked really good in the US and now sell it in their local
9:17
market so this video is actually 3 minutes long so we're not going to watch all of it but right away he took a copy
9:24
that works the hook is that copy that works and this is really important to understand you want the audience to love
9:31
your video from the beginning to have a good hook but again we're going to get to marketing later what he did next was
9:36
he unboxed the product now if he would have started the video from here you don't know what he's doing you don't
9:42
know what he's about to show you and he's going to lose a lot of viewers this way again this is marketing tactics for
9:47
later but to summarize this is what he did with his product research he saw what's working for another seller and he
9:52
took it and turned it into his own success story even if that product was being sold already even if the product
9:57
seems saturated because there there's tens of thousands of people who are buying it that does not mean anything so
10:03
that is the first product that I wanted to show you now as you see here in the Shopify Drop Shipping cheat sheets I put
10:08
all of the links to everything that I'm talking about so all of these competitor ads as well as the source link so if you
10:14
want to see where he's sourcing this product from you can see right here on AliExpress for just
10:19
$321 and they're selling it for much much more than that but again this is marketing we're going to get to it later
10:25
I want to keep everything in its own place so you got the links to all of that in the Shopify Drop Shipping cheat
10:30
sheet if you want access to this all you have to do is comment right below this video # Shopify let me know what is your
10:36
top take away what did you learn from this video and I will gladly send you the link to this cheat sheet take
10:42
advantage of it and take actionable steps to start your store the right way without leaving anything behind the
10:47
second product is a portable baby dining chair I want to open up the three competitors here as well and show you
10:53
what they're doing so again we've got one product and three people who are selling it well of course there are more people selling it but it's here to show
11:00
you that there is no such thing as product saturation here is the portable baby dining chair so this video copy
11:06
right here again it's not sponsored so it's a completely organic video got almost 10 million views 730,000 likes
11:13
and well you guys see all the crazy details over here if you had a video that went this crazy you're going to be
11:18
super happy with the sales that will follow as long as of course you got everything right on your store and you got the payment set up and everything
11:23
that I will show you further down this video so let's check out these 12 seconds and see what the seller did that worked out so well I can already tell
11:30
you from a first glance that the view is great the setting the environment and the baby just looks really really cute
11:36
just want to squeeze those cheeks so you can just pretty much see the product in action so here was the product here was
11:41
the baby he was happy chill and here's how easy it is to set up the chair you can put your accessories behind it and
11:47
just look at the baby chilling out right here okay pretty cool went super viral for a quick 10-second video here is the
11:53
second one and this one is on Facebook so you do not have to of course put everything on Tik Tok yes it is an
12:00
amazing platform that's going to get you crazy traffic when you do things right but it's not the only platform out there
12:05
that exists of course we're going to go through all of the platforms and I'm going to upload videos to each and every one of them inside this video but again
12:12
we're going to leave that for the marketing so this is the second person second seller selling this product
12:17
16-second video kind of a different vibe so you got this like upbeat music in the
12:25
background and you can see a few kids using it and all older one a younger one
12:30
and it just shows you the product in action 1,800 likes pretty good 745,000
12:35
plays absolutely crazy lots of clicks lots of purchases and here is the third seller now here you can see that she
12:42
also did her own thing she ordered two of them to her house and now she's simply recording an organic video this
12:47
one did not work as well as the first one as you can see by the engagements here again super crazy if you get 20,000
12:54
video views your product is also going to go viral and you're going to make a lot of sales but this just comes to show
12:59
you that you can sell the same product in different
13:06
ways so here we got some Kanye West music in the background and here the setting isn't as wonderful right they're
13:12
just like sitting up against the wall instead of some nice uh outdoor camping or Beach setting but it still worked
13:17
really well and you can still sell the same product with a different angle with a different hook and you can also Target
13:23
the same audiences but again we're going to leave all of these marketing tips for later and again I left all of the links inside the cheat sheet for this product
13:29
as well okay so before we do our product research let's go over the best Drop Shipping niches that we can do our
13:35
product research in and find winning products because there are a lot of categories that we can sell and a lot of
13:41
them are not relevant to the Drop Shipping business model but to the ones that are relevant there are hundreds of
13:46
millions of products inside them that we can sell so here are the best Drop Shipping niches that are also Evergreen
13:53
Evergreen means that these products sell all year long I don't want you to only sell seasonal products especially not
13:58
right from the start and the reason for that is because I don't want you to make a lot of sales during that season and
14:03
then you're going to notice a big drop once that season is over I want you to make consistent sales all throughout the
14:08
year and after that you can throw in the seasonal products which sell at a much higher volume during that holiday season
14:15
but then again after that you're going to notice the drop so it's good to have a nice mixture of both but for your first store make sure that you're
14:20
selling an evergreen product so here are the best Evergreen niches pet toys and supplies Beauty and health jewelry
14:27
watches and accessories patio lawn and garden toys and games Office Products consumer electronics hair extensions and
14:34
wigs home decor kitchen and dining mobile phone and tablet accessories baby
14:39
products men and women's clothing and of course kids clothing as well outdoor camping Sports and Fitness and security
14:46
surveillance now again all of these categories have subcategories and sub niches with millions of products inside
14:53
but these are the categories these are the main categories that you want to focus on and soon I'm also going to talk
14:58
about the products that you cannot sell the products that you want to avoid in order to not get into any kind of legal
15:03
trouble or anything like that so we will be covering all sides of this but right now let's move on to the best product
15:09
research methods both manual and automatic the reason that I'm showing you both is because I want you to have
15:15
all of the best methods and you will choose what is best for you now when it comes to me I am a big big fan of
15:21
automation I've been automating my stores for over eight years now and once you automation you really cannot go back
15:28
but i' still started the manual way when I was starting off there wasn't much automation back then so I had to pretty
15:33
much do everything manually and if you are starting on a budget and you want to learn things from the bottom up you can
15:39
start with manual and then move to automation when you're ready to start taking shortcuts but also start scaling
15:44
your business so here are some of the best manual product research methods that we have available today the first
15:50
starting with Amazon's new tool it's in beta testing now so hopefully by the time you're watching this video it's
15:55
still happening it's called Rufus and this only Rec L came out so meet Rufus
16:01
Amazon's new shopping AI you can simply ask him a question that relates to product research to products that are
16:07
being sold right now and they will give you the answer so just log into your Amazon account and here on the top left
16:13
you have this rofus icon we're going to click on it and we can ask Rufus a question hello Rufus what are the best
16:19
kitchen and dining products people are buying now enter and we can see that
16:26
he's thinking here are some great options okay so check it out we got an instant
16:31
pot to cook food quickly we've got a pressure cooker we've got a vitamin blender and more and more cooking
16:38
accessories now of course you can take it deeper like for example let's say that there is a certain product that you like like a dog costume okay so let's
16:46
say what are the best dog costumes people are buying now so you can start
16:53
general by searching for a specific category or you can narrow it down and search for a specific product type and
16:59
we can see some options right here so we've got this lion costume over here we've got this pirate costume hot dog
17:06
costume which is pretty funny cuz it's a dog dog shark costume a unicorn costume
17:11
also looks pretty cute and this kind of helps you with your product research and also even start to narrow it down so I
17:16
think that that's a great tool and you can get more examples of other questions that people are asking and so that also
17:22
gives you an indication of what people are typing what the questions that people are asking and this way you can
17:27
give them a solution by selling them a product that they are looking for so Amazon maybe a little bit late to the AI
17:34
game but definitely better late than never the second manual product research method and again all of the manual does
17:40
not require any budget at all you can start doing your product research right now right after watching this section of
17:46
the video go and do your product research after I give you all the tools and you'll see that this is a very conventional way to do it it's time
17:52
consuming just like starting any other business but you will be able to find some great ideas here especially if you
17:58
do not want to start with automatic product research methods right away with all of the benefits that that has as
18:03
well which I will get to in a few minutes so the second one is Amazon's best sellers and movers and shakers so
18:10
these are two categories on Amazon which I'm able to get a lot of product ideas on now just because we're searching for
18:15
products on Amazon doing our product research here it doesn't mean that we're going to use Amazon as a supplier we'll also get to the supplier section as well
18:22
in this video and I'm going to do a deep dive there as well into all of the different regions and and shipping
18:27
speeds and selling policies and return policies and all of that but if you go to Amazon's best sellers you can find a
18:33
lot of products here that are selling well now there's a lot of products here that we cannot sell right like Apple products and big Brands we're going to
18:40
go over everything that we cannot sell soon but this will still give you a good idea of the types of products you can sell so I already gave you a list of the
18:47
best Drop Shipping categories let's take one of those into example right here on the left side so inside best sellers I'm
18:53
going to click on home and kitchen okay and here we're starting to narrow it down a bit and we can narrow it down some more by looking at another
18:59
subcategory over here on the left side so let's go with storage and no let's go
19:05
with kitchen and dining even deeper into kitchen and dining and now I want to look for let's go with storage and
19:11
organization okay so here I'm getting some more ideas okay let's scroll a bit we've got these insulated lunch boxes
19:17
which look pretty cool we got these nice kids leak proof lunch boxes over here okay so I'm already starting to get some
19:23
ideas but we'll need to further narrow it down we can just pick a product from here and say okay let's go with that one
19:29
this is just giving you the starting position for finding products to sell so let's say for example we like the idea
19:35
of this product right here magnetic spice storage for your fridge so you put it on the side of the fridge so let's
19:41
look for magnetic spice storage products so here for example I can just head over to Tik Tok and here search for magnetic
19:49
spice storage and see if there's any other sellers who are selling this product and here I already found it
19:55
right here 152,000 views for that same product and I did that really quickly
20:01
and as I scroll down I can see more people selling this product so this gives you the idea of is there even any
20:07
demand for this product is is are people even interested in it and you can see well first of all not just from the
20:12
engagements and that it was uploaded recently but also by just reading in the comments below I already have them does
20:18
it come with the magnetic board which is something that you'll want to write on your website because you see that people
20:24
are asking this question so you can get an idea of what people are looking for I love mine I want more already I just got
20:30
it it holds on wood so we can learn a lot from the comments as well so if the product is in demand and what else are
20:37
customers talking about around this product so that's one way to quickly check if these products have demand now
20:43
as I mentioned there's a few more criteria to making sure that it is a product that's in demand and that's why
20:48
you want to make sure that it has all of these preconditions and also remembering that it is supposed to also be an
20:53
evergreen product so that product of course was an evergreen one it can be used in the winter some summer and any
20:59
other season and besides it being Evergreen we do want to start with a general store first so we do not want to
21:04
start with a niche store we do not want to start with a one product store I'm not saying that that's not going to work
21:10
but if you start with a one product store and you put so much work and effort into it and it ends up not working out because the product simply
21:16
is not interesting then you're going to go through what people call a burnout phase and you're going to think that
21:22
this is simply not going to work maybe it's not the right thing for you and you're actually missing out on the big
21:27
picture so we want to start with a general store where we can easily test lots of products and see which ones are
21:33
actually selling and it's going to be really easy to do that once we put Automation in place I'm going to talk about all of that later in the video and
21:39
I'm going to as always give you both options you can do everything manually or you can do it the automatic method
21:45
and be able to scale much much faster and easier it all depends on what you actually want to get out of this
21:50
business so we easily found one trending product using Amazon's best sellers another method is Amazon's movers and
21:57
shakers movers and shakers Akers is almost the same as best sellers so if I just scroll up and I click on best
22:03
sellers I can also see right here on the right side movers and shakers and if I click on that I'm going to see the most
22:09
trending products the biggest gainers in the last 24 hours and this will help you get a picture of what's trending right
22:16
now on Amazon and not just what sold really well 6 months ago and now it's just kind of eh so again you can dive
22:23
deeper inside the categories so let's do this time maybe clothing shoes and jewelry and we can get some nice ideas
22:29
here in the fashion niche of what's been selling really well in the last 24 to 48 hours so that is another one of my
22:36
methods now the third is again using Amazon but this time we're going to see how many times a product sold in the
22:43
last month so it's kind of the same as movers and shers where it shows you recent demands recent Trends but here
22:49
you can actually get a number and see how many people purchased this product in the last month and the way to do that
22:54
is you'll need to log into an Amazon account doesn't cost anybody to make one but without that I just noticed that
22:59
they do not give you this information and now if I search for anything like uh let's say pet hair removal products and
23:05
I scroll down a bit let me zoom in so that you can see it better under each product I can see how many times these
23:11
products sold in the last month so this one right here sold 1,000 in the last month this pet High removal product sold
23:16
400 300 this one right here sold 30,000 units in the last month that is
23:22
absolutely crazy especially for the cost of $24.99 which is not as cheap as $4.98
23:27
for this cheaper her removable product so that is absolutely amazing this one right here sold 2,000 in the last month
23:34
and you get the picture the more I scroll the more we can learn what products are out there in this Niche and
23:40
how many times they are being sold in the last month so that gives us another indication and then again you can just
23:46
take that product and search for it on social media on Tik Tok on YouTube on Facebook and see what other sellers did
23:52
with this similar product and you can do the same for yourself go viral with your videos and scale up from there all of
23:58
which I will get to soon later in this video so that is another nice method that I like to use another one is called
24:04
the AliExpress Drop Shipping Center now this used to work a lot better A couple of years ago again you have a link to
24:11
everything that I'm talking about inside the Shopify Drop Shipping cheat sheet # Shopify what you learn in this video and
24:17
I will send you the link to this cheat sheet but again I want you guys to learn don't ask for it before you watch the
24:22
video and took all of the value that I have for you here so that you can actually succeed and not just trying to
24:27
run forward really quickly while keeping one eye shut so the AliExpress Drop Shipping Center you will you will need
24:33
an AliExpress account so just log into your account and you will have the Drop Shipping Center inside your profile
24:39
under your orders dashboard you will see it says DS Center so you'll click on that again you have the link to it in the cheat sheet and you'll get to this
24:45
place right here find products to sell and you've got some winning product ideas here and you can kind of scroll
24:50
and you can see how many times each one sold in the last month kind of the same as um Amazon but there is not as much
24:57
product analytics as used to give you so let's say I want this cool looking UV nil dryer lamp right here okay so I
25:04
clicked on it and it took me to the regular product page so nothing really special here but what I can do is I can
25:11
copy the URL to this product and go back to the Drop Shipping Center scroll all
25:16
the way up and then we going to click here on product analysis and here I can provide the link and click on analyze
25:23
data and now it's going to pull up information about other similar products that are similar to that main product
25:28
that I search for and we can see how many orders each one has so this UV LED nail Light lamp got 2,000 orders this
25:35
one right here 200 but again we are not getting that much information the amount that we're used to getting from the Drop
25:42
Shipping Center so it is a place to get more winning product ideas doesn't cost any money to use it we can get some nice
25:49
ideas here especially if we start to narrow down some more and jump into categories and sub niches and start
25:55
searching for those products as well okay so start analyzing them search for them on social media see what other
26:00
sellers are doing and that is another quick way to do it especially because AliExpress's categories are mostly all
26:07
Drop Shipping friendly when compared to Amazon's categories which are not all Drop Shipping friendly for example we
26:13
cannot sell Prime Video Amazon music we cannot sell Echo and Alexa fire tablets Fire TV all of these categories which we
26:19
cannot sell and even if we go by Department there's a bunch that we can sell but also a bunch that we can't so
26:24
we can use the cheat sheet to understand where we can sell but Al expresses categories does make it a little bit
26:30
easier so we talked about Amazon's new AI tool Rufus we talked about Amazon's bestsellers movers and shakers and
26:35
seeing the amount that sold in the last month we talked about the AliExpress Drop Shipping Center and the new changes that AliExpress implemented there now
26:42
let's talk about the reverse product research method so another manual method another way for us to organically find
26:49
other competitors that are selling products that are going super super viral and the way to do that is to
26:54
search for specific hashtags using the social media channels that we're aware of so I'm just going to use Tik Tok as
27:00
an example again the reason that I'm doing it is because it's just much bigger than other social media channels when it comes to short form video
27:07
content you can do the same searches on Instagram on YouTube and on Facebook as well but Tik Tok is my usual go-to just
27:14
because of the amount of people that are on it and the amount of data that we can get from here so we're going to search Tik Tok for social media hashtag trends
27:20
like product Trends Amazon finds Amazon bestseller gadgets and Tik Tok made me buy it and what you kind of want to do
27:27
here is engage with these Drop Shipping product videos so that the algorithm will automatically start to understand
27:33
okay this is what this user is trying to look for they want to look for these types of products and people who are
27:39
selling these types of products so we're going to start showing them more videos like this on their feed so by engaging with these ad copies what you want to do
27:45
for example is let me take the first one here so I'm going to take product Trends and I'm going to search for that right here on Tik Tok then I'm going to click
27:51
on videos okay so we can see a whole bunch of uh different products right here and I can guarantee that 99% % of
27:58
these products are all from drop shippers they are all Drop Shipping products so let's just take a look at one of these for example like this one
28:05
right here so this is a pretty cool Vegetable Slicer I haven't seen this one before it does have a wow effect and it
28:11
does also solve a problem so it's nice to have both of them and then if we click on it we can get more information
28:17
we can see that a lot of people have been uh replying to this we can see when they've been replying to make sure that it's not an old video and we can see
28:23
what the seller did inside that video copy and the engagements here are crazy crazy crazy so another thing that you
28:29
can do is click on that seller to see what other products he's selling and what other products are simply going
28:34
well for him so you can see that he is uploading a whole bunch of videos on different products right so it's a
28:40
general store the way that we want to do it and there's just a whole bunch of trending products that he's trying out here I can see that he used some
28:46
influencers to do some of his marketing some of his videos user generated content creators and so forth we're
28:52
going to talk about all of these methods soon and I will also Implement them but if I scroll up we can see that he has a
28:57
URL so this is the link in BIO and if we go to it we can see the seller store and everything else that he's selling I'm
29:03
not going to do that now cuz we're not doing marketing yet but that is another nice way to find trending products and
29:08
if you like that product you can search for it and narrow down on it even some more inside Tik Tok or whatever social
29:15
media channel you're using so let's see this one for example what is this product it's from the same seller and
29:21
here he selling a it turns fruit into to ice cream I
29:29
haven't heard of that before and so whatever you like here you can also see what other sellers are doing by searching for that exact product so just
29:36
like I did just a few minutes ago you can do the same so this looks like a portable printer right
29:43
here oh well it's all from the same seller because we're under his store okay let's go back to our search so it
29:48
was product Trends and let's look for just another product really quickly we can even do the other ones like Amazon
29:55
finds and then click on videos and here here we are getting more examples more products and again you can check out
30:01
like let's say this uh back massager right here right or shoulder massager let's see if that product is still trending right now so shoulder massager
30:09
and look at how many people are selling this product this person right here this video was just uploaded a week ago
30:16
358,000 views amazing this one here is actually showing you how to do a shoulder massage so they're not all
30:22
selling that product you want to take a look and maybe we're going to call it portable or electronic so we can narrow
30:28
down some more and find only that product and here we go now we found some more just by adding that one word
30:34
portable right and we can see these three sellers right here 47 million views that is crazy these three sellers
30:40
right here and again this may get you to think that the product is saturated but you won't know until you try it with
30:47
your target audience with your wonderful Hooks and I've proved to you that there is no such thing as product saturation
30:52
you can see how many sellers are having success at it and more and more are definitely going to join with this product so that is another way you're
30:59
going to search for these social media hasht trends you're going to find their websites in the bio you're going to find
31:04
the source by searching for it on alexpress and this way you can upload this product by yourself really quickly
31:10
with these wonderful product research methods but again that is not the only way to do it and we're not only going to
31:15
work with AliExpress in fact I always recommend to not work with AliExpress you can use them as a product research
31:21
method but there are much better agents out there much better sources and I'm going to go through all of that again
31:26
soon so that is enough of manual product research I guarantee that if you take these methods into action you will find
31:33
winning products but to help you understand out of all of the products that you're finding which of these products are actual winners and which
31:39
ones you will have a much higher chance to sell them in your store you are going to want to use the product research Drop
31:46
Shipping cheat sheet which again I left a link to inside this cheat sheet so I'm going to click on it and it's going to
31:53
take you to this spreadsheet right here and what you want to do here is you want to write down the information that
31:58
you're getting from these products so like this product right here was a smart RGB pickup light uh I found it on
32:05
AliExpress so I put the URL right here and then we want to answer a series of questions are you even passionate about
32:11
this product at all because if you don't like it if you don't care about it if it's something that you don't like it's going to be a little bit harder for you
32:17
to order the product create videos and sell it and don't worry if you don't want to create videos and all of that I'm going to go through all of the
32:22
methods in the way that you can Market your products both free and paid methods and both can go absolutely crazy but
32:29
again you want to at least have some kind of a passion or like this product at the very least is this product hard
32:35
to find in stores or can anyone just go to a local store and also find this product is it hard to guess the price of
32:41
this product is it safe to sell does it solve a problem or stand out does it sell for over $30 and does it comply
32:48
with Facebook's ad policies even if you're not looking to run Facebook ads you can click on this link inside the
32:54
product research Drop Shipping spreadsheet and see what are Facebook or metas ad policies and this will give you
33:00
a good indication of if you should sell this product even if you don't want to use uh Facebook ads it does give you a
33:06
whole bunch of what you can do and what you cannot do or what products are good or not good to run ads on and try to
33:13
Market to the General market so once you answer yes to all questions on a certain
33:19
product that will have a much higher chance of selling on your stores than other products where you answered no to
33:26
at least one or more of these columns okay so you're going to jot down all the information all of the potential
33:32
products that you're finding from the methods that I'm showing you in this video and that will help you narrow down even further which products you should
33:38
actually put an effort into try and sell so those are all of the best manual product research methods now let's move
33:44
to the automated product research to shave off hours days weeks and months of
33:50
our time using the power of artificial intelligence and Automation and as you
33:56
know I'm a firm believer of it it I've been using it for years now and I highly suggest just giving it a try because
34:02
once you do you will not going to want to go back to doing everything manually but all the methods are out there it's up for you to choose what is best for
34:08
your business when it comes to automated product research the number one tool for
34:14
that today on the market not just for product research but for so many other things which I will go to later in this
34:19
video is autods the all-in-one Number One Drop Shipping automation tool and
34:25
now we're just going to cover the product research section of it starting with the autods marketplace inside the
34:32
autods marketplace there's a whole bunch of things that you're going to get including lots of winning products
34:37
trending products private suppliers that you can work with that can even offer their own customizable branding with
34:44
your logo on the products that they ship out for you and we also have the autods warehouse so autods has its own
34:50
Warehouse where it chooses the best products from years and years of research in a huge database of trending
34:57
prodct products so a lot of that can be sourced directly from autod DS's warehouse and you've also got ads byy
35:02
tools and so much more so besides just going over the features let's just actually see it in action so this right
35:08
here is the autods marketplace and here we can see under the marketplace that we've got three categories handpick
35:14
products ad spy and trending products but before we even click on any one of them we can simply stay in the
35:20
marketplace and here under supplier you can choose if you want to work with retail and wholesale suppliers or if you
35:25
want to work with private autods suppliers ERS and I suggest going with the private just so that you can have an exclusive competitive over other drop
35:32
shippers who are not working with these private suppliers and that cannot brand their products because we're using the drop shooing business model and no one
35:39
is going to Brand your products if you're not going to purchase a minimum order quantity only here it's not needed
35:44
you can purchase products only after you make a sale and it will get sent out with your logo those that have
35:49
customizable branding right here as you can see in front of the product so this marketplace right here full of retail
35:56
wholesale and price private suppliers has a whole bunch of trending products these suppliers know what's selling well
36:02
on the market and this way you will not have to go out and try to find these products manually because you have it
36:08
all crammed up over here inside the marketplace under different suppliers as we can see some of them ship from the US
36:14
so if the US is your target audience you can ship within 46 business days which is incredibly fast no customer today
36:20
wants to wait 3 to four weeks to get their items but again that is for the supplier section you can choose
36:26
different categories so if you want to sell under a specific Niche or want to find a product under a specific category you can just click on that here and you
36:32
can see whatever ships to a certain country so for example if you're Target countries that United States and you
36:37
want to Target them you want to find products that can obviously ship to the United States but you can also do a
36:43
ships from so I want to see products that can also ship from the United States and here I'm keeping it domestic
36:48
and the shipping will be super quick so this is another filter that you can use here you can also play with price ranges and so forth you can click on best
36:54
sellers or only see those that have fast shipping and anyway this is is going to give you a quick idea of products that
37:00
are trending on the market right now and if you're using autods and you already connected your stores and you're already aware of this platform and all of its
37:06
features and you want to start selling these products like this smart pets interactive snack launcher which is
37:11
pretty cool haven't seen that before if you want to sell this all you have to do is Click right here on import draft and it'll import to your store right away
37:17
and you can start selling it and clicking on it will give you more product information inside including
37:23
where it chips from more product information shipping policies return return policies and as we can see for
37:29
this product right here we've got only one variation if you would have more variations you'll be able to click on it and it shows you that variation and same
37:35
goes here for the size you can see that this one ships from a few countries so it can ship from the US from China from
37:41
Canada and from the United Kingdom and more than that we can also send private messages to these suppliers but again
37:47
I'm going to leave all of this for the supplier section of the video and we get more things like the shipping policy and the return policy for this product so we
37:54
can understand what policies we can move on further to our buyers and that is the first automated product research methods
38:01
lots of winning product ideas right here all you have to do is go inside see what you want to sell and import them to your
38:07
store no need to go through what I can and what I cannot sell you can sell all of these products all of them are
38:13
perfect for the Drop Shipping business model so the first is the autods marketplace the second is the handpicked
38:19
products now the handpicked products is exactly what it sounds like we've got a team working on this morning to evening
38:26
finding all of these products for you including what products are selling well who's selling these products links to
38:33
their videos and their ad copies on this product links to their websites how much they're selling it for how much they're
38:39
profiting where they're sourcing it from and everything else so let me show you a few quick examples I'm in the handpicked
38:46
product section and I can already see a whole bunch of cool products that I can sell on my store and again I've got the
38:52
import draft so I can just add it to my store really quickly but before that let's get some more information so let's
38:57
start with the first one right here we can see that it was uploaded uh two days ago and it is a headlight so I'm going
39:04
to click on it and get more information inside so first I can get some information on the product like reviews a title the potential profit that we can
39:11
make how much it's being sold for how many orders it has an engagement and a saturation score so the engagement score
39:17
the higher it is the more engagements it's getting on social media and saturation the higher it is the more
39:22
it's saturated now we already talked about product saturation but we also have a saturation score here here and
39:28
you've also got target audience so this helps you understand how to Target your audience if you are trying to run ads on
39:34
this product what types of audiences you would want to try and Target like male or female the age range their marital
39:40
status their main interest like hiking camping outdoor activities night running for this type of headlamp and
39:46
occupations that they may have then as we scroll down we've also got social media ads or video copies or organic
39:52
videos that went really crazy viral for these sellers and as you can see right here we've got two face face videos or
39:58
two Facebook ads for this product you'll also have Tik Tok if there were Tik Tok videos that were also found for it as
40:03
well but you can click right here on see original ad to actually see this video
40:08
in action and we can see right here the video description what they wrote about the product and we can see that this one
40:14
made 3,000 likes on Facebook 250 comments 233 shares so went absolutely
40:19
viral and we can see right here that there are showing the product in action and the the light power here is
40:24
incredible look at that Absol absolutely crazy so really nice looking product we
40:30
can see the second video right here so we can get a good examples of what worked well for these sellers this one also went pretty viral 1,000 likes 250
40:36
comments 75 shares and this one is showing it on his head and again this looks absolutely
40:43
amazing so this is just a quick product that we were able to find from 2 seconds of product research and we've got all of
40:49
the sellers websites right here so I can click on one of these websites and see what they did on their website so this
40:54
one right here is selling it for $27.99 Shi is not included free shipping only on orders over $60 so let's add another
41:00
$6 at least so we're looking at around $35 right here and the item cost is just $5.60 with another $1.99 shipping if you
41:08
don't pass uh $10 with 13 days uh shipping which can be sourced for a faster shipping times which I will get
41:14
to uh later but as you saw right here we were able to get this product really quickly using the handpick product
41:20
section and as we continue scrolling down we've also got Auto disc Insight so we can learn some more about this product and that's it if we've got more
41:26
variations you'll see them right here import draft added to your store this one specifically ships from China and you can search for it on other places as
41:33
well such as Amazon Facebook and Ali Express we've also got the product information so you can see right here
41:38
all of the product info coming from the supplier so if you add this product to your store all this information will move over to your store as well the
41:45
product specifications as well as the policies and reviews that this product got okay so really nice handpicked
41:51
products you can spend a lot of time here and find crazy crazy good products let's just see one more quick example
41:58
let's see this led jellyfish tank NightLight I like it I haven't seen it before in other places it looks unique
42:05
it may not be a problem solver unless your problem is that I don't have enough nice Aesthetics in my house it's more of
42:11
a wow effect which is also good so it's an LED jellyfish tank NightLight we can
42:16
make some crazy profit potential here engagement score is really high and saturation score is relatively low
42:23
meaning that there is a really good opportunity for this product Target audience as well and here let's check
42:29
out some of these videos to see how well they're performing all right so let's open up some of these video ad copies and we can see that these were on Tik
42:42
Tok okay so this first one here got 10,000 likes 118,000 views this second
42:48
one got 594 th000 views and 4,200 likes and the third one went absolutely crazy
42:55
5.7 million views 304,000 comments and it's not sponsored it is an organic
43:02
video let's see this video right now in
43:12
action wow really nice so this is AD copy number one or video copy number one
43:19
this is number two he's adding Coke that's controversial I hope the
43:26
jellyfish don't die and this guy this solved all my sleeping
43:31
issues so he started with a problem solver and then showed it in action pretty relatively quickly so all three
43:36
of these went pretty viral and this is actually a pretty cool product so let's see one of the stores selling this product solar flame flickering lamp
43:44
torch you didn't even say the word jellyfish in it $60 and for us the sourcing price is
43:49
much much much much cheaper than that welcome to the profitable Drop Shipping business model okay so that is the
43:56
handpicked products I hope that You all take advantage of it inside the autods system just so you know autods cost just
44:01
$1 to try out for 14 days so if you're using autods definitely take advantage of the handpick products the second
44:08
method here is the ad spy so here you've got Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok
44:13
ad spy where you can easily find products that are selling well for other sellers so here we're not going to get
44:18
the whole product information and the source and their websites and all of that we're simply going to get the video copies of these products that are
44:25
working really well for them and we'll do the rest of the research ourselves so let's see an example let's look for
44:30
products that have anywhere between 1,000 to 10,000 likes so we're narrowing it down a lot but I want to also see a
44:36
linked product and we can also choose the CTA button tag so does it say shop now or order now I want to leave that
44:43
open for now and interaction rate I would say more than 1% of the people are actually interacting with this product
44:49
and here we can start to scroll and just look for oh my gosh and just look for Drop Shipping products products that we
44:55
see that these sellers are trying to sell like check out this retro handheld console right here it got 1,000 likes 27
45:02
comments okay let me click on see Tik Tok ad and we can get more information here like we can actually watch the
45:07
video from here so we can see it in action we can see the total engagements right here we can see the engagements
45:14
chart to see when this video started trending which is just in the last week it's going crazy absolutely Bonkers
45:20
right now as we speak and more add information here the video duration the country or region in this case it's a
45:25
United States the language is English and the network is Tik Tok so I can click on C original post and I can
45:31
actually see the whole video right here and then you can of course search for that and see other sellers who are selling it but don't forget to engage as
45:38
I said before you want to see more products like this again this belongs to marketing but we are going to engage I'm going to give it a like you can write
45:44
something in the comments you can save you can share and that way the algorithm will show you more and more videos that are related to drop shipping products
45:51
and that you are easily going to see more and more trending products that are good for Drop Shipping so that is the ad
45:58
spy take advantage of that lots of new products that you can learn from right from this section and the third is
46:04
trending products now the trending products is somewhat similar to handpicked products only here it's not
46:10
being found by our team this is actually all done with the work of artificial intelligence so we have a sophisticated
46:16
AI model that is finding these products and getting all the rest of the information including who's selling them
46:22
the sources and all of that and puts it all together in a nice little package for you so let's take something from the
46:27
first row here let's say this um folding camping cut right here okay so let's take a look at this portable mattress so
46:34
we can see all the products information so the products title how many times it sold the profit potential the interaction rate the amount of reviews
46:41
that it got from other buyers the selling price and we're also giving it a product score now not sure why this one
46:46
scored pretty low but let's see the rest of the information the product distribution is the places that this
46:51
product is being sold at the most so we can see at the Russian Federation Mexico and the United States France Brazil and
46:57
so forth and the general sales when did this product start selling and we can see that it's been selling for a while
47:02
but the graph just keeps going up so between March and April there was a small drop but since then it really
47:08
started booming and as we scroll down we can also see the video ads or the video copies for this product we can see the
47:13
amount of engagements right here and we can click on see original to see the actual video in action and the amount of
47:19
engagements and how these sellers marketed these products so this is another great place to find winning
47:25
products to sell and of course you've got the products information and you can choose your shipping option right here
47:31
in this case we've only got standard shipping and it does deliver within 4 to8 business days which is great and
47:36
here we do have more variation so you got gray and blue and black and so forth and if you want to sell it all you have
47:42
to do is click on import draft right here and start selling it on your store let's see one more quick example from
47:48
the trending product section so let's just scroll and look for something that can catch our eye like this Clos steamer
47:56
over here that looks looks pretty cool let's click on that okay this one is pretty crazy it sold over 10,000 units
48:01
and we can see that it's being distributed to a bunch of countries with the us not being one of them the US is only 3% that's that's interesting maybe
48:09
it should sell there a little bit more and we can see the whole chart right here the product sales chart and right now it's actually doing pretty well and
48:16
we've got the ad copies of the videos right here look 13,000 likes 177,000 likes 12,000 likes that is pretty
48:24
crazy so here's just one example of the video I know that we've seen enough videos for now and we want to actually jump into product research but just
48:30
check out the amount of information and these cool products that we can find right here from just a few minutes of
48:35
product research so again you've got all the info right here import it to your store by clicking on this button and
48:40
boom you're selling this product it ships within 2 to five business days so that is relatively quickly and that is another quick way to find products so we
48:47
talked about the marketplace we talked about handpicked products the ad spy and the trending products all of this is
48:53
automated product research made to shave an endless amount of time on product research so again we've got all of the
48:59
manual product research methods and we've got the best automated product research methods you really do not need
49:04
any more product research methods when it comes to automated methods or manual methods and I'm sure that this is going
49:10
to give you the best ideas and the most potential products that you can sell on the market not yesterday not half a year
49:17
or a year ago but today so whatever method you choose I suggest playing around with it mixing around these
49:23
product research methods and see which ones find the biggest and fastest potential winners for your store because
49:29
while you do want to spend a lot of time on product research and fill in all of your answers here in the product research Drop Shipping spreadsheet you
49:36
still want to be able to narrow down the best winners and that is what you're going to get by following these product
49:42
research method so take advantage of it and now let's do some live product research and find what products I'm
49:48
going to sell on the store that I will be creating in this video all right so let's take all the information that we
49:54
were able to gather and use the methods that I talked about to find winning products to sell in the store that I
49:59
will create in this video so I'm going to be playing around with a bunch of these methods and let's see which ones find the best products for us to
50:10
sell all right so I'm done with my product research and I chose two products let me show you how I found
50:16
them so I play around with all of the methods that I provided in this video and I ended up finding them really
50:22
quickly in the handpicked products Hub so the first one is this portable alarm door stopper which I think is a really
50:28
cool product so if you don't have a lock or if you want to add another way of
50:33
having an alarm when somebody tries to open a door this product pretty much does that for you I like that I haven't
50:39
really seen it before and when searching for it on Tik Tok portable alarm door
50:45
stopper I was able to find that there are a few sellers or several sellers who are selling this product but there are
50:52
also a bunch of other variations for it and I think that this is the nicest looking one of of them so again it looks
50:58
like it's kind of saturated again not the end of the world like I said we can still sell saturated products and I
51:05
really don't have hours and hours of work to put into this I want to do this really quickly show you guys how to find
51:11
shortcuts get a couple of really goodlooking items order them shoot videos and start to Market them on my
51:17
stores while building everything side by side as you guys watch everything that I do so this is product number one that I
51:24
have my eyes on and the second one is this cat steam brush right here which
51:29
looks super saturated on the market but I'm still going to do it anyway because I think that there's a lot of potential in this product and it doesn't mean that
51:35
the whole world saw it already so I'm going to take my chances with this one as well and if I search for this one on
51:41
Tik Tok so let's just go for cat steam brush but wait before that let me just show you how this uh product is selling
51:47
so this seller right here got 62,000 likes on the uh portable alarm door uh stopper uh this one right here 28,000
51:54
37,000 3,800 so a lot of sellers are having a lot of success with this product and I want to take a part of
52:01
that success take a small piece of the cake and enjoy some of these sales and profits that these sellers are making so
52:06
what I'm going to do is I'm going to order the product to my address and I'm going to shoot some videos on this product I'm going to post it on Tik Tok
52:12
and Instagram and other marketing methods that I will talk about soon um but overall yeah this is product number one that I'm going to try it stands
52:19
under my criteria of what makes a winning Drop Shipping product and I'm going to soon figure out what customers
52:24
are looking for by again going through the comments that I showed about so this guy right here saying hey he can't find
52:30
it oh just it's in the link in my bio look he can't the seller doesn't even have good English I can't find it in the
52:36
Tik Tok shop please find it on my profile website where can I buy it so these commenters are having a hard time
52:43
they want this product and the seller is not making it easy for them to understand where that is so that is one of the things that I'm going to tackle
52:49
when I create the video for this product so we can learn a lot again from the comments that we read from inside these
52:55
product videos and the second product is the cat steam brush so let's take a look at that one so we can see that this one
53:01
also is a problem solver and it also kind of has a wow effect right oh I didn't know that we can you know make Steam come out of our brushes and make
53:08
brushing our cat's hair like easier so yeah 1.6 million views here 29,000 here
53:13
308,000 here so this product is going absolutely viral for a whole bunch of Sellers and the more I scroll the more
53:20
products the more sellers you can see that are selling the same product look 22 million people saw this video right
53:26
here imagine the amount of sales that this product is already making for other Sellers and I'm still going to try to
53:31
dive in and I'm still going to try to take this product now I'm not saying hey guys sell only saturated products you're
53:37
going to have more time than me than I have to make this video you're going to have more time for product research when
53:42
you are doing it for your business but I still want to show you look how much I'm scrolling this product is being sold an
53:48
amazing amount of times for a whole bunch of other sellers so this is what I
53:54
call a saturated product look I'm scrolling Non-Stop and there's more and more but I have two cats and I can make
54:00
a special video and I can get the rest of the people who didn't see this product yet who didn't see these videos
54:07
or maybe they saw it and they couldn't find out where the seller is selling these products and anything else I'm
54:12
going to grab some of these sales so that is product number two the cat dog
54:17
steam hairbrush those are the two products that I'm going for I added all of their information inside the Shopify
54:23
Drop Shipping cheat sheet again # Shopify let me know what is your top takeaway from this video what did you
54:29
learn and I will happily send you this cheat sheet with all of the information that I'm showing you in this video of
54:34
course I'm throwing in a lot more extra value and extra bonuses in the video but you will definitely need the step-by-step cheat sheet so I've got the
54:41
pet steam hair comb and the alarm door stopper with the marketplace links with the source with the video ad copies and
54:48
the sellers websites who are also selling these products and we're going to take a lot of examples from the other
54:54
sellers who are selling these products and we're going to do a much better job on our website that I will create and
55:00
I'm not making it a one product store I am going to make it a general store so this is a second sell's website we're
55:05
going to dive into all of this stuff later we're going to do a much better job than them and I can show you how to make much better websites even though
55:11
product research is more important remember that it's more important than the way that your website looks even if
55:17
your product page doesn't look super professional you want to sell the right product to the right target audience they're still going to purchase it but
55:23
still I'm going to show you how to make a really goodlooking website you're going to look like a registered brand a
55:29
trademark and you're going to look much better than all of these sellers that we are seeing here so I'm going to order
55:34
those two products and once I get them I'm going to show you exactly what I'm doing with them how I'm going to Market
55:40
them how I'm going to upload them to my store how I'm going to create my product pages and all of the extra things that I'm going to add in to do a much better
55:47
job than our competitors and while we wait for the product to arrive from AliExpress before I move on to creating
55:54
the Shopify store and showing you how to register everything and configuring all of your store settings and putting
56:00
everything in place let's take a minute to understand what are the Drop Shipping products that we need to avoid that we
56:06
definitely cannot sell so the types of products that we want to avoid are big Brands copyrighted products and
56:12
trademarks so of course don't sell any big name brands that you are aware of you cannot sell Apple iPhones or video
56:20
game consoles uh Sony products Coca-Cola and simply any other big regist brand
56:26
stay away from that don't worry about it there's enough products that you can sell so if it's a brand that you've heard of if it's registered if it's
56:33
trademark stay completely away from it next is Alcohol Tobacco and ecigarettes you don't want anything to do with that
56:40
there's no reason to sell those products and there's a lot of legal issues with selling them so stay away from that let
56:45
the big Brands let the big companies take care of those products next no maternity vitamins and supplement
56:51
products we are not doctors we are not prescribers and we do not have the authority to sell these products on our
56:57
stores next this one should be obvious but no drugs and no drug paraphernalia so no bongs and nothing that has to do
57:04
with and around the world of drugs Firearms ammunitions weapons all completely out of the picture don't sell
57:11
anything that's dangerous do not sell hazardous and no dangerous items no choking hazard products no liquids and
57:19
in general stay away from food and beverages we are not grocery stores this is not great for the Drop Shipping
57:25
business model so if we stay away from these types of products and these types of Brands and trademarks we shouldn't
57:31
have any trouble whatsoever and if you are using autods to add your products to your stores then you'll already have a
57:37
warning if you're trying to sell a product that you're not allowed to autods has a huge Vero database with a
57:42
whole bunch of products and brands that do not allow the reselling of their products so if you're ever trying to add
57:47
those types of products you will get a warning message before it is added to your store so take that as another layer
57:53
of protection that you are getting from the system if you're not using not ODS just put four eyes on the product that
57:59
you are trying to sell and make sure that they do not fall under the categories of products that we should
58:04
avoid Drop Shipping having said that do not worry there are hundreds of millions
58:09
of great winning products that you can sell on the market and that is one of the things that we are tackling in this
58:16
video so pay attention to that do your product research well put a lot of time into it do your narrowing down find your
58:22
potential winners and once you do that once you are ready with the products and you know what you want to list on your
58:28
stores the first product that you want to start testing we can move on to the next part of creating our Shopify store
58:34
once we create our Shopify store we're going to find the best suppliers to work with then we're going to import Our
58:40
Winning products to our stores learn how to Market them in the best ways both free organic and paid methods to scale
58:47
our stores to get a whole bunch of orders then we're going to learn how to fulfill our orders provide great
58:52
customer service and learn how to use all of the data that we're Gathering everything that we are gaining to
58:58
further scale and multiply our success and keep the big numbers rolling in so
59:03
that's everything in a nutshell but there's so much more to cover so let's move on to the next part and create our
59:08
Shopify stores so now that we finished with product research we know what we're going to sell it's time to register for
59:14
a Shopify store and start actually creating it configuring all the settings and then we are going to prepare to
59:21
import our products to our stores start marketing and start selling so let's take it from the top we are going to
59:26
register for a new Shopify store and inside the Shopify Drop Shipping cheat sheet you do have a free Shopify trial
59:34
so sign up using the link that you have right here but before that we need to generate a name for our new business now
59:41
we can always change this later down the line but it will be more practical for us moving forward to think of our
59:47
business name now so there are a few tools that can help us do that the first is called free business name generator
59:53
now there's a few websites that give you this type of service but but what I like about this one is that it's very simple
59:59
you don't need to create any accounts to generate any business names and you also have a free cool domain lookup tool now
1:00:04
I'm going to talk about domains in a minute and I'm also going to show you how you can get your own do store domain
1:00:10
absolutely for free so let's go ahead and dive into this business name generator now I did say that we're going
1:00:15
to start with a general store just to make things easy and to be able to test the market well before diving into a
1:00:21
specific Niche and thinking about one product stores so for that we're just going to look for or anything that's very general so you can start off very
1:00:29
Broad and just write something like General Store and here you can give a description but you don't really need to
1:00:34
just click on submit already and here it's going to give us a few names now think about a general idea that you
1:00:40
would like to have because the more broad you go the broader the answers are going to be but you can already get some examples here from the results that we
1:00:47
got for example Village Variety Store what else do I like here everything here looks like a retail store Sunrise
1:00:54
General Store traditions General Store so all very very broad but of course you can dive in even deeper if you want like
1:01:00
for example let's say you like daily deals the way that that sounds and you're going to be offering all kinds of deals so now you're kind of narrowing it
1:01:07
down further and helping it give you better results like daily deal Haven instant deal picks daily savings Hub
1:01:14
daily day Hub and so forth now what you can do is click on check availability and this will also show you if there are
1:01:21
domain names available with this term so deal day hub has for example deal
1:01:27
hub.net deal hub.org deal hub.com but again we do not need these options
1:01:32
because I'm going to show you how to get your own dot store for free and I think that that is a much much better bargain so this is one place where you can
1:01:39
generate a nice business name for free the other one is using good old chat GPT
1:01:44
so I created a quick prompt generate General Store name ideas and I got these 10 ideas right here and this did kind of
1:01:51
help me be able to narrow down these ideas further because I did like the third option Prime pick so I could go
1:01:57
something along the lines of prime picks and I could check this out again here or
1:02:03
with the space in the middle to get even more generated ideas but then again prime pick kind of got me thinking of
1:02:10
Amazon because it's got the whole Amazon Prime thing going on so then I thought even further okay Amazon is a great name
1:02:16
what does Amazon make me think of it makes me think of being out there in the wilderness in the jungle so maybe I'm
1:02:23
going to put those two things together so I really like the way that Prime jungle sounds so with the help of these
1:02:28
two free AI tools I was able to think of a pretty cool name for my business and that is the one that I'm going to go
1:02:34
with so now that I know the name of my business I know what products I'm going to sell on it it's time to actually get
1:02:39
started and register for my store and start creating it and I didn't want to spend any time signing up to Shopify up
1:02:45
until this point because I'm going to get a free trial but after that free trial is over I'm going to have to
1:02:51
choose a basic plan for my Shopify store and in order to not waste time I did not sign up for Shopify up until now so now
1:02:58
is a sweet spot now is when we actually want to register to Shopify and start creating our store again comment #
1:03:04
Shopify let me know what is your top takeaway from this video what did you learn and I'm going to give you access to this cheat sheet with all of the
1:03:11
links and resources and tools inside now Shopify has a wonderful offer and this
1:03:16
offer changes from time to time so be sure to take advantage of it while you still can so the current offer stands at
1:03:24
getting 3 month mons of Shopify so you can create your store on Shopify and use it for three whole months and you're
1:03:31
only going to pay $1 for every month so three months for $1 that's $3 in total
1:03:38
for three months of Hosting your website on Shopify so that is a great great deal
1:03:44
and in order to take advantage of this deal all you have to do is use the Shopify registration sign up link that I
1:03:51
left inside the Shopify Drop Shipping cheat sheet or you can also find the link right below this video so as soon
1:03:58
as you click on it you're going to be greeted with this page right here get your first three months for $1 now by
1:04:03
the time you're watching this video If this offer changed to one month or anything else that is simply because
1:04:09
this is a limited time offer so again take advantage of it while you can while I'm recording this video it is 3 months
1:04:15
for $1 so we're going to sign up add your email address right here and go ahead and click on start free trial and
1:04:22
that will begin the registration process and this way you're going to to get your first three months for $1 now on top of
1:04:28
that Shopify also added something new on top of paying $1 for3 months you're also
1:04:34
going to be able to earn up to $110,000 in credit so what exactly does that mean
1:04:40
this means that every time you make a sale you're actually going to get some cash back and in this case it is a 1%
1:04:47
cash back that you can use as credits on your Shopify subscription so in other
1:04:53
words let's say I just made $100 in sales I just made a $1 cash back that I can
1:04:58
use to redeem off of my Shopify plan so if for example I made $11,000 worth of
1:05:03
transactions and this is not even profit this is just total revenue so if for example I made $1,000 in sales on
1:05:10
Shopify I'm going to get $10 that I can use as cash back if I made $10,000 in sales I'm going to get
1:05:16
$100 off of my Shopify plan and making $10,000 in sales is actually not that
1:05:22
hard once you learn how to do it so take advantage of this amazing offer that I haven't seen Shopify make before but
1:05:27
again do keep in mind that it is a limited time offer so sign up now use the affiliate link that I left for you
1:05:33
so that you could take advantage of this wonderful wonderful deal all right so we're going to go ahead and click on
1:05:38
start free trial and continue with the registration process now if you've already registered for Shopify using
1:05:43
that email address you can go ahead and use another email address so that you can claim your free trial and take
1:05:48
advantage of it so here let's get started which one of these best describes you I'm just going to skip all so that I can go ahead and continue with
1:05:55
my store because we don't really need to give Shopify all of this information before all right so where will your
1:06:01
business be located here you're going to put the actual location where you reside in so I'm going to go in the United
1:06:07
States and now I need to create a Shopify account so I'm going to sign up with email I'm going to drop that email
1:06:14
right here below and generate a quick password verify that I am a human being
1:06:20
and not some AI bot then I'm going to go ahead and click on create Shopify account everything here is very simple
1:06:25
very straightforward so now I'm just going to wait and let Shopify do its thing while it's creating my store in the background it should take less than
1:06:31
a minute all right and here we go I got my Shopify dashboard 3 days left in your trial and that is why I did not want to
1:06:37
waste any time until now for registering so now we can go ahead and get started
1:06:42
so the first thing that I want to do is do a basic dashboard and menus overview and after that we're going to start
1:06:48
configuring our store settings and in order to do that correctly I did create a step by-step right here in the cheat
1:06:54
sheet all of the things that we need to do from selecting our store currencies to plans and Billings payments checkouts
1:06:59
shipping zones deliveries shipping rates Warehouse locations markets and so forth
1:07:04
and at the end we are going to connect it with a domain so that's all a part of the next settings that we are going to configure and these are the first
1:07:10
settings before we start working on our logos and our cover images and importing our products and start marketing this is
1:07:16
the stuff that we have to get down before we can do any of that so that this way nothing will be missed and we
1:07:21
will be able to start selling without any road bumps or drawbacks so let's go to the Shopify dashboard the first
1:07:27
things that we see here is the home so we got this nice little onboarding process right here we do not need to be
1:07:33
a part of it I'm going to take you through all of the important steps everything that you do want and need to do then we've got the orders page so
1:07:39
this is where our orders are going to come in then we've got the products so all of our products that we're going to list are going to be shown here and
1:07:46
we've got the customers so we're going to have all of our customers information here whether it's those that left their email address or those that purchased
1:07:53
from our stores or just left information and didn't really take any action or abandon their cards and all of that then
1:07:59
we've got the finance section so here's where we're going to see all of our payouts and we've got these store analytics so this is where we're going
1:08:05
to see where the traffic is coming from how many people landed in our stores and what they did and all of the actions
1:08:10
that they took in our store customer behavior and so forth marketing is where we can run payperclick campaigns so
1:08:16
we're going to touch up on all of that soon and discounts is where we can create promotional offers so you don't
1:08:22
need to do anything yet I just wanted to give you a quick run through of what all of these menus are and what it means
1:08:28
then we've got online store so this is where we are actually going to configure our online store for example our store's
1:08:33
theme we're going to customize it we're going to only use the free themes and also I don't know if you guys noticed
1:08:39
this but I'm going to keep you guys on a budget throughout this whole store creation process because it could get
1:08:45
pretty tricky with pricing it could get pretty expensive for people who don't have a lot of experience in this field
1:08:50
thinking that you need to put in money in places where you actually don't so I'm going to keep everything as free free as possible as budget friendly as
1:08:57
possible and you will only actually start to scale once you start to make some sales and you'll be able to invest
1:09:03
those funds back into your business now if you do have a starting budget you can move to the paid methods because I'm
1:09:08
going to be talking both about free and the paid methods to do everything just so that you'll have all of the options
1:09:13
laid out in front of you so whether you're on a budget or not this video is going to walk you through each step of the way so here we've got the themes and
1:09:20
as I mentioned we're going to go with a free theme because it's more than enough to drive sales blog post is to create our blog so we're going to go over that
1:09:26
as well because that gives us free organic traffic to our stores pages is to create additional Pages like policy
1:09:32
Pages the navigation menu where we're going to put the links on the top and on the bottom of our websites and More
1:09:37
Store preferences that will be relevant of course I will be going through all of that in this video so that is a quick
1:09:43
overview of the Shopify store dashboard so what is the first thing that we actually want to do once we registered
1:09:49
for a free trial and we're waiting right here on this screen well the first thing that you can do is select a Shopify plan
1:09:55
you don't have to do that right now you've got three whole days to do it but I'm going to do it now just to get it
1:10:00
out of the way because I know that I'm going to keep running this tour for more than those three days so the first thing
1:10:05
that we're going to pay our first expense is just $1 after my three free
1:10:11
days are over so here I'm going to go with the basic plan and we can see what that plan includes it's going to cost $1
1:10:18
for the first month so first I get three free days then I've got 30 days one
1:10:23
month for just $1 and and then after that 1 month and 3 days I'm going to start paying for the regular plan which
1:10:30
is $29 a month now by then we're already making sales we're already making profit
1:10:35
and we're going to use some of our profits to pay for our plans and continue raking in more sales and more
1:10:40
profits and then we're going to withdraw those profits to our bank once we got these small expenses out of the way so
1:10:46
that is the first expense $1 after 3 days then $29 after 1 month in 3 days
1:10:52
I'm going to go ahead and do that now but you can do it again at any any time you want during the process after your 3
1:10:58
days are up you're going to have to do this you're still going to pay only $1 for one month and then start your
1:11:04
regular plan after that so I'm going to fill in my details right now really quick and get this over
1:11:11
with okay so I'm submitting the information right now and that's it you've successfully subscribed and now I
1:11:16
can provide my business information but I don't need to do that now I'm just going to click on ADD later and we'll get to all of that inside the store
1:11:22
setup anyway now if you'd like to look at your account information at your plans what you're paying for and what you're getting simply head over to the
1:11:28
settings here on the bottom left and here you'll have the plan so I'm going to click on the plan link and here you
1:11:34
can see that I've only paid $1 and this will end about a month and 4 days from today until then I only paid $1 and
1:11:41
after that I'm going to pay for the regular basic plan which is $39 a month what that gives me is credit card rates
1:11:47
at 2.9% transaction fees plus 30 cents and that is for online in person doesn't matter cuz we are not selling in person
1:11:54
and if I click on view more features I can see more plans that are available but then again starting with the basic
1:12:00
is more than enough we've got everything that we need right there to start our businesses start making sales and start
1:12:05
scaling so we're going to get to the whole fees and the break events and all of that but I just wanted to give you a quick overview of how much you're going
1:12:11
to pay and when you're going to pay so it's really worth it to start with a free trial get those first few days for
1:12:16
free then pay only $1 for one month and this way your expenses really are low
1:12:22
when you are starting off and this is the great thing about the Drop Shipping business model is that we can start making sales before we actually spend
1:12:28
any money or at least spend large amounts of money that we otherwise would have to spend much more and also much
1:12:34
more in advance when running a regular brick in Mortar business so the Drop Shipping business model comes with a
1:12:40
really low startup investment so it's really nice to have that lowcost entry barrier when starting off especially
1:12:46
when we've got the right tools and knowledge which is what I'm passing on to you in this video so that you can really start the right way and maximize
1:12:53
the chances of success even and especially while on a budget now one second before we move on to configuring
1:12:59
our store settings there's one more thing that I want you to know if you do not want to create your store completely
1:13:04
from scratch like I'm doing so in this video if you want to have that done for you absolutely for free autods has an AI
1:13:11
store Builder if you don't want to do all of that by yourself you can now get a free pre-built AI generated Shopify
1:13:18
store with winning products already inside and this store is ready to sell in order to get this pre-built AI store
1:13:25
I left a link inside the cheat sheet it says autods has a free Shopify AI store Builder with winning products and apps
1:13:32
pre-installed so you're going to click on that link and here you've got your AI Shopify store in less than 2 minutes so
1:13:38
you're going to go ahead and click on get started now I have a lot more to talk about autods as an all-in-one Drop
1:13:43
Shipping automation platform and this is going to be a must in order to not only automate your business but really help
1:13:49
you scale and hit those High numbers and one of those features inside is the AI built Shopify store so here you're
1:13:56
simply going to choose your favorite Niche and you're going to get a store within 2 minutes to your email it's
1:14:01
already branded it's already got winning products it's already got recommended Shopify apps installed and you're also
1:14:07
going to get your own store free domain so all of that is included and like I
1:14:12
said it's absolutely for free all you need is an autods plan which I will also get to soon so again there's the full
1:14:19
way of creating your store like I'm doing so in this video and you can also go ahead and get the AI pre-built store
1:14:24
for you in both cases this video continues on the same whether you created the store with me or whether you
1:14:30
had it done with AI we are going to continue configuring the store the the exact same way so the link to that is
1:14:37
inside that cheat sheet once again and now whichever method you decided to go with we are going to start configuring
1:14:42
our store settings so the first thing that we want to do is select a store currency and don't worry I'm going to
1:14:48
talk more about autods soon the trial there is only $1 for 14 days again more on that soon for now let's continue by
1:14:54
conf configuring our store settings and starting off by selecting our store currency so here what we're going to do
1:15:00
is not only keep our store currency on the same currency that we are using so for example if I'm selling in USD US
1:15:06
Dollars then my store currency is going to be that as well but I also want to enable location-based currencies and
1:15:13
what this gives me or my customers is the option for them to see their local currency when visiting my store so even
1:15:19
if I'm selling in US dollars but I also sell to a country that sells in Great Britain pounds then that way they're
1:15:26
going to see GBP and not USD when entering my website Shopify will make that conversion for us automatically so
1:15:32
in order to get to that and that's the first thing that we're going to do inside our Shopify dashboard we're going to click on settings then we're going to
1:15:38
go to markets and under markets we're going to click here on preferences and here under pricing we have the option
1:15:46
local currencies let customers pay in their local currency so I'm going to click on that and make sure that you've
1:15:52
got International here checked in so this means that all of the customers that are outside my base location
1:15:58
outside the United States I want them to have the option to see my store in their own local currency whatever that may be
1:16:05
now I'm going to talk about more options soon like how to make sure that everybody in the world can see our store and also how to make sure that everybody
1:16:11
in the world will have the checkout option or at least all of the places that we can ship to I'm going to get to all of that stuff soon so I'm trying to
1:16:17
answer your questions before you even get to it because there's a handful of settings that we need to go through and we want to make sure that everything
1:16:23
here is covered so make make sure that you've enabled location based currencies under settings markets preferences now
1:16:31
remember that Shopify may change the menus every now and then so if that happens just look around at their menus
1:16:36
and see where it makes most sense and you will be able to find it because from video to video that I record they
1:16:41
usually update a few menu placements all right so after store currency we're going to move over to plan and billing
1:16:48
so I already took care of this but this is the place where you are going to create your Shopify plan so it's under
1:16:54
settings you've got plan and also billing so now it's in two different places so one is
1:17:00
the Shopify plan which as we know I already signed up for the basic plan $1 for the first month and you've got the
1:17:06
billing so this is which credit card they're actually going to charge you if you already created a plan you already added your credit card you're going to
1:17:12
see it right here if not you can go to billing add your credit card first then go to plan and select your plan and
1:17:18
it'll choose a credit card under your billing so in any case any money that you owe Shopify will be taken off from
1:17:23
whatever payment details added under billing next is payments now payments is
1:17:29
how customers are going to pay us not how we pay Shopify but how customers pay us so again we're under Store settings
1:17:36
and here we've got payments Shopify payments let your customers pay their
1:17:41
way with Shopify payments what this will give customers is the option to pay with credit cards to check out with much more
1:17:48
payment options that Shopify will be able to offer them once you sign up for Shopify payments now Shopify does
1:17:54
automatically create a PayPal account when you create the Shopify account under the same details so it's going to
1:18:00
use your email address and it creates a Shopify account for you so here you do want to continue with the PayPal setup
1:18:07
but you also want to have Shopify payments because that will just open up the store to many more customers who
1:18:12
will be able to check out under your website now granted PayPal does give you the credit card option so even if your
1:18:19
customers do not have PayPal they can still pay with it using the guest checkout option but some customers
1:18:26
simply do not want to work with PayPal do not want to go with Express guest checkout options and they simply want to
1:18:32
put their credit card field in a place that looks better to them more secure and it gives them that peace of mind so
1:18:37
that is why we are going to enable both of these options and this will increase the amount of people who can and will
1:18:43
purchase from our website now the thing with Shopify payments is you've got different payment providers around the
1:18:50
world so it really depends on where you live where you reside so here under payments I let a link to the Shopify
1:18:55
payment gateways link and that will take you to this website where you can see all of the options all of the third-
1:19:02
party payment providers in all of the countries worldwide so here for example if you live in Australia so your
1:19:08
business is based there it's located there so I'm going to type in Australia and here are all of the options that I
1:19:14
have I can use air wallets or bankful or bitpay and all of the rest of these options as we hear so let's say I'm
1:19:20
going to go with this one here called payment wall so I need to reach out to them so I'm going to go to their website and I'm going to reach out to payment
1:19:26
wall and tell them hey guys I have a Shopify store and I would like to connect it with you what are your
1:19:32
options what are your transaction fees and they will give you the answer and all of these payment providers know how
1:19:38
to connect their payment service to your store so that way you'll be connected with Shopify payments and we're also
1:19:44
going to do the same again for PayPal PayPal is a little bit easier it's a little bit more seamless but either way
1:19:49
we're going to have to get this done and another way to see what all the options that you have are is here under the
1:19:55
settings SL payments you can click right down here under Shopify payments this link called see all other providers if
1:20:01
you want to use a different payment provider on your store so if Shopify doesn't automatically give you the Shopify payments option it means that
1:20:07
you reside in a country that Shopify payments is not supported and for that you can go ahead and click on see all
1:20:13
other providers and this will show you the rest of the providers that you can work with based on your location but
1:20:19
again if you want to get the full list just use the link that I have inside the cheat sheet under Shopify payments and that will take you to the this full
1:20:25
providers page and here just search once again for your country and it'll give you all of the options okay so we're
1:20:30
going to connect with one of those payment providers in my case it's going to be Shopify payment so I'm just going to click here on complete account setup
1:20:37
and I'm going to start providing information about the business so that I can get verified and start working with Shopify payments now again if you do not
1:20:44
have the Shopify payments do not panic just work with another payment provider like I said just reach out to them let
1:20:50
them know that you have a Shopify store and you would like to integrate them inside your Shopify store don't know exactly what the steps are and they'll
1:20:56
walk you through it whichever one you choose doesn't really matter as long as Shopify supports them and they are under
1:21:01
the list of Shopify payment providers you won't have any issue and your customers will be able to check out
1:21:06
using their credit card and other types of payment information so I'm just going to start with the options I'm running
1:21:12
the store as an individual you can go with registered business if you are one or a nonprofit in our case it's going to
1:21:17
be one of the first two options so in this case I'm going to go with a registered business business type sole
1:21:23
proprietorship and I'm going to click on next and if at this point you're asking yourself do I need to create a business in order to
1:21:29
run a Shopify store the short answer to that is yes the long answer to that is set up a meeting with a local accountant
1:21:36
wherever you live and let them know that you would like to create a Shopify store and that you are using the Drop Shipping business model so you're not purchasing
1:21:42
any inventory anything up front and what countries you are shipping from and to and they will get back to you with all
1:21:47
of the details all in all this is not legal advice but you will most likely only have to pay for income tax on your
1:21:54
actual profits not on your revenue of course and the only tax that you'll have to pay is when purchasing the product
1:22:00
from the source so from your supplier you're paying a tax when you're checking out and you might also have to pay a tax
1:22:05
to the country that you are shipping to on Shopify and they will give you the information for that because there is a
1:22:11
threshold for every type of country and if you don't reach that minimum you don't really need to pay any taxes so
1:22:16
you can get all that information from the local accountant but in general you're on your first steps here so there's nothing that you'll have to pay
1:22:23
yet until you actually start h hitting some numbers but you're going to get all the information that you need but in any case no one can really run a business
1:22:29
nowadays without a local accountant so make sure that you get one on the phone get to know the ins and outs depending
1:22:35
on wherever you live around the world but the great thing here is that it's super flexible and you can drop ship
1:22:40
from anywhere to anywhere in the world so let's go ahead and get back into it and if you chose individual or business
1:22:47
you're going to have to start filling in your individual information like your SSN if you live in the US or depending
1:22:53
on what country you live you'll get a different type of verification to set up it's usually governmen issued ID things
1:22:58
like that nothing out of the ordinary out of the usual stuff uh in this case it's a business for me so I'm going to go with the business info so I'm just
1:23:05
going to fill in all the info really quick there's nothing really special here so I'll see you after the fast
1:23:17
forward okay next under industry type under category I'm going to go with retail and under subcategory or we're
1:23:25
going to go with anything close even though these are all Niche stores so I'm just going to choose one of these that
1:23:30
will be relevant to most of the products which is maybe this one Hobbies toys and games okay description of products and
1:23:37
services so I sell General goods from Toys hobbies to other categories people
1:23:47
are looking for you just want a quick brief we're going to click on next and now the account representative
1:23:58
okay so we're going to go through all of the details make sure that everything is correct and as it should be and you can
1:24:03
see that it says down here if you are registering as a business to improve the chances of your business details being verified you can upload a verification
1:24:10
document such as a financial statement in this case I'm going to go ahead and confirm the details without giving that
1:24:15
information and we'll see if they get back to me with that in any case we only want to give the right info where we can
1:24:21
actually back that up with documented verification and information so make sure that you have everything at hand
1:24:27
whether you're going as an individual or as a business now I know that this may seem like a lot but really it only takes
1:24:33
a few minutes off of our plate and there's a good reason why I'm doing all of this boring technical stuff right
1:24:38
here before we get into the action before we start adding our products and optimizing and marketing and doing all
1:24:44
of the exciting stuff it's because these are essential and important steps that other people simply do not talk to you
1:24:50
about and I want you by the end of this video to have everything l out for you
1:24:55
so that you can copy my action plans step by step and start actually making sales and profit so I'm not going to
1:25:01
leave anything out and even though we got to do this boring stuff in the beginning we're going to do the boring stuff in the beginning right now and get
1:25:08
it over with all right so to finish setting up my Shopify payments I'm going to go through the info once again and
1:25:13
I'm going to click on submit for verification once I see that all of my information is here ready for review
1:25:19
okay so my account information has been submitted for verification so we can cross out the next part of Shopify
1:25:25
payments so we selected our store currency we made sure that it's location based we added our Shopify plan and our
1:25:31
billing information and we just finished setting up Shopify payments I'm just going to do the PayPal setup really
1:25:37
quick and then we can move on to the next part which is the actual Store settings like the checkout shipping and
1:25:42
delivery locations and so forth all right so on our store settings we're going to click on payments again and as
1:25:48
we can see right now Shopify payments is under manage and it lets my customers have all of these checkout options with
1:25:54
which will much further increase the chances of them checking out giving them all of the options that they actually
1:25:59
have instead of just only limiting them to having a PayPal account or a guest checkout which most do not really like
1:26:06
so PayPal is good as an added bonus but your main should always be Shopify payments or a thirdparty service that
1:26:12
you connected here following my instructions all right so I'm going to set up the PayPal account really quick
1:26:17
so you can see that a PayPal account has already been created with the email that I registered on Shopify with so I'm going to go ahead and click on complete
1:26:25
setup and I'm going to start filling in the information so email address the country where I'm from generate a
1:26:32
password and continue with the rest of the regular registration
1:26:38
information okay so information filled in agree and create the account okay and now describe the
1:26:45
business so I'm just going to write the word General miscellaneous general merchandise monthly sales um up to
1:26:53
$5,000 at this point point do you have a website yes that is my Shopify website so for now we're going to give them our
1:26:59
regular uh Shopify URL which is not a nice looking URL because we didn't add our store name yet which we'll do soon
1:27:05
but right now this is the really bad URL that we have which we are going to fix
1:27:11
very very soon so again you could have done the whole domain thing before this and then add the domain here in any case it doesn't really matter because this is
1:27:17
going to redirect to The
1:27:22
Domain okay once we submit all of our information please confirm your email to activate your account so we're going to
1:27:29
go back to here we got this email from PayPal I'm going to click on get started
1:27:35
now and now that I sign into to my Paypal account you can see the information right here I do need to
1:27:41
confirm my email so I'm going to click here I'm going to click on confirm they didn't send me an email so let's wait
1:27:48
for it this time to confirm that it is there we go please activate your account I'm going to click on that and click
1:27:53
here to activate your account log to your PayPal we are human and your email has
1:28:00
been confirmed okay so our PayPal account is ready our Shopify payments is also ready well under verification but
1:28:07
it's going to be ready and now if I go back to the payments options let's see
1:28:12
what we have here okay so it looks like the Shopify payments account is already ready no further verification needed so
1:28:18
we can see right now that my balance is $0 but I do have a payout account I can already start using this as a payment
1:28:23
option which is the best payment option and here under PayPal we will wait for it to pass the verification process
1:28:29
which probably won't take too long just like the regular Shopify payments okay so the payments part is finished now we
1:28:35
can not only pay Shopify whatever we owe them but we can also get paid from our customers once we start making sales so
1:28:42
now that we finished setting up our store currency our Shopify plan and billing and our payments options so that
1:28:47
we not only have to pay Shopify for whatever we owe them but we can also get paid from our customers once we actually
1:28:52
start to make some sales now we're going to configure the rest of the settings starting with the checkout option so
1:28:59
we're going to go to settings and here we've got the checkout options right here so the first thing that we want to do here is under customer contact method
1:29:06
we've got phone number or email that is the option that you want to have then under customer information you want to
1:29:12
have require first and last name and that's simply because when you are shipping out the products to the
1:29:18
customers you want to make sure that the first and the last name will be provided on the shipping label so that the
1:29:24
delivery will not get mixed up with somebody else so here instead of only require last name we're going to change
1:29:29
it to require first and last name so when a customer checks out they will have to fill in their first and their
1:29:35
last name and everything else can stay as is except for shipping address phone number so company name does not need to
1:29:41
be included address line number two is only optional don't make it don't include cuz some do have a line too but
1:29:47
it only needs to be optional shipping address phone number should be an option
1:29:52
so optional so if if a customer provides their phone number you can go ahead and provide it in the order as well but if
1:29:58
they don't provide you with a phone number that's also fine you can send it out without a phone number packages will still get delivered but if we get a
1:30:05
phone number all the better add it to the order as well it does not have to be required I do not want customers to feel
1:30:11
like they're forced into giving me their phone numbers if they don't want to because I can still deliver the package
1:30:16
without it so we're just going to leave that as an option now you can go through the rest of the options but everything
1:30:21
else can pretty much stay as is then I'm going to go ahead and click on save so here we can see that the settings have
1:30:27
been saved and we're going to move on to the next option which is right here shipping and delivery so just continue
1:30:33
along with the cheat sheet after the checkout we've got shipping and delivery so here I'm going to click on shipping
1:30:38
and delivery and here we've got all of our options so we've got the regular shipping choose where you ship where you
1:30:44
ship from and how much you charge for shipping at checkout so this shows customers which Warehouse you are
1:30:50
shipping from under which country which location so so let's begin under shipping choose where you ship and how
1:30:57
much you charge for each shipping at checkout so you may see that you already have a default profile that was created
1:31:03
but here I have a whole bunch of options which I don't want to use I don't want to charge all of these prices for shipping so I'm going to disregard that
1:31:10
one and create another profile so I'm going to click here on new profile and I'm going to call it us shipping and
1:31:17
under products I can add whatever products are relevant to it but I don't have any products yet we're going to do that later and then when we add the
1:31:23
products we're going to have the option to select What shipping policy to give out to these products so I can skip that
1:31:28
for now and under fulfillment location this is where we are actually fulfilling the orders from so what needs to be
1:31:36
correct here is the country where the products are being shipped from and if you're going to be working like me with
1:31:41
multiple suppliers then you're not only going to be shipping from one location now you do not need the same exact
1:31:47
address as where the products are being shipped from but you do need to select the right count so for example if you're
1:31:52
going to use a supplier that ships from the US then we are going to create a Us address and it can be any address in the
1:31:59
us if we ship from China then we're going to create another one from China with an address from China same thing
1:32:06
with Australia or UK or anywhere else that we want to ship from now my tip here if you're wondering where do I
1:32:12
actually want to ship from I don't have that info yet then think about who you want to ship to so if on your first
1:32:18
store you want the domestic country to be the United States it doesn't mean that you have to be from there you can ship any from around the world to the
1:32:25
United States and also to the rest of the world but you do need one main target audience in this case for me in
1:32:32
this tour it's going to be the United States but there are other great locations to choose from like Australia New Zealand United Kingdom England and
1:32:40
so forth so there's a lot of places where you can ship to but in this case if my main target audience is the us
1:32:46
then I also want my ships from to be the US I want to ship from into the same country so that my shipping will be as
1:32:52
fast as possible now some suppliers that we're going to work with are going to ship from other locations like China for
1:32:57
example and that is also fine so that is why we're going to create multiple shipping options depending on where
1:33:03
we're shipping from and as you create your store as you do your product research as you look for suppliers which
1:33:09
is the next section in this video you will see where they're shipping from and you can always come back here and revise
1:33:15
or create new shipping profiles and assign each product to its own shipping profile so let's just create one from
1:33:21
the US for now and one from China so this is going to be called us shipping the Fulfillment location is from the
1:33:27
United States and I'm going to add a new shipping zone so this is what other countries this product can ship out to
1:33:33
so first we're going to give this Zone a name so I'm going to call it us Zone and this ships to the United States which
1:33:40
should be obvious however in all of the states I do want to remove two states from this one is Hawaii and the other is
1:33:48
Puerto Rico and that is simply because there are a lot of shipping problems to those places and they most of the time
1:33:55
get delayed or get returned so I'm just going to keep 60 out of the 62 states in
1:34:00
the US and now I need to add a rate so now we're saying okay you're fulfilling
1:34:05
from the United States you're shipping to the United States how much is that
1:34:10
going to cost the customers so here I'm going to click on ADD rate and we are going to give them a flat rate of $0 now
1:34:18
the reason that we're doing that is even if we're paying for shipping in some cases okay let's say the product cost $5
1:34:24
and shipping costs another $2 so we're paying a total of $7 we would rather see
1:34:29
all of that in our source price and give our customers free shipping so for
1:34:34
example instead of costing $5 it's actually going to cost us $7 and from that we're going to cut our break even
1:34:41
and how much we want to profit so we're going to get into all of the pricing and stuff soon but in any case know that you are going to offer free shipping to your
1:34:47
customers it just looks better nobody likes to see a shipping price free shipping always looks and sounds better
1:34:53
and we can still maintain the profit percentage that we want to make from those orders so under pricing I'm going
1:35:00
to keep it free and under shipping rate we need to choose how fast we can deliver after we provide tracking
1:35:07
information so in this case I'm going to keep it around economy or standard Express one or two business days can get
1:35:13
a little bit risky so you want to make sure that your supplier can actually put up with that but now just to keep it on
1:35:19
the save side and make sure that I can ship my products out in time I'm going to make it5 to eight business days and
1:35:25
as I get to know my suppliers better as I start to build and maintain my relationships and check their shipping times I can always come back and change
1:35:32
this accordingly so economy 5 to8 business days for free and we are going to create this shipping template so I
1:35:38
clicked on done and we have our fulfillment location as well as our shipping zone now of course you can add
1:35:44
more countries let's say you want to open up to the rest of the world so you're going to to create another Zone
1:35:49
and this one is going to be called worldwide and here I'm going to fill in all of Asia so we've got all of Asia in
1:35:55
here and you can also ship to all of Europe and of course you can click on these to include or exclude some
1:36:01
specific locations but in this case I do want to ship to worldwide especially if we're using suppliers that can ship to
1:36:07
worldwide which we will go over all the suppliers soon so I'm going to add another one for worldwide so now I'm
1:36:13
going to add a rate which is going to be under worldwide we already have the rate for under the US now we're creating
1:36:18
another one for worldwide okay so again another rate and here we're still going to offer free shipping
1:36:24
only here we are going to choose economy International 6 to 18 business days because it simply takes longer to ship
1:36:30
internationally so we want to keep it safe we're going to keep it for free and we're going to click on done okay great
1:36:36
so now we have our shipping Zone we have our fulfillment location so we know where we're shipping from and we know what countries we can ship to which is
1:36:42
the us as our main and the rest of the world and they both have their different shipping times and they're all going to
1:36:48
be shipped for free now what happens once we want to add another ships from location so we got the ships from us but
1:36:54
what happens if we also want to ship from for example China so first of all I'm going to click on Save just to make
1:36:59
sure that we're saving all of our settings and now we can see it much better we can see the custom shipping rate that we added and this is the one
1:37:06
that we're going to use we're going to make sure that our products that we're adding that ship from the US are going
1:37:12
to have this shipping template so I'm going to show you that when we actually start importing products but what about
1:37:17
the rest of the world if I click on this custom shipping rate and I scroll down you can see that below the US shipping
1:37:24
Zone we also have the worldwide one but it says customers in worldwide won't be able to check out because all countries
1:37:30
regions are in an inactive Market to activate go to market so that's what we're going to do now you can do it
1:37:35
simply by clicking on markets over here on the left side or by clicking on the link here in the message in any case
1:37:41
it's going to take us to the markets under the international settings and here you can see Market settings languages and domains is fine its
1:37:47
English it's got the domain before we actually create a domain which we'll do soon products and pricing is in USD but
1:37:53
local currencies is on as we mentioned as we talked about duties and import taxes this is only if and when you'll
1:38:00
actually need to start collecting taxes which is why I advise speaking with your local accountant but there is a
1:38:05
threshold for most countries in the world so you won't have to start paying right away and shipping so we've got three rates and two profiles we're
1:38:11
shipping to 27 countries and regions so basically the only thing that we need to do is activate this plan so here under
1:38:18
inactive we're going to click on that and turn it into active now I'm going to click on Save and this Market is now
1:38:24
activated so if I go back to shipping and delivery and I click on my custom shipping rates right here us shipping
1:38:31
now I can see that this shipping zone for worldwide is also activated so we've got shipping from the US to the US and
1:38:40
to worldwide is activated and working correctly now one quick tip that I'd like to give you here under shipping and
1:38:46
delivery is that you can add another rate so if for example you are shipping from into the US and you notice that you
1:38:53
ship quick quicker than 5 to8 business days you can play a little trick here it's not a must but you can click on ADD
1:38:58
rate and say okay I've already worked with this supplier and I know that they ship within one to two business days so
1:39:04
we can give them the express option but why not make a little bit more money on the side so here for example you can
1:39:09
give them the express option for $4.99 and this way you're adding another
1:39:14
rate where they can ship much faster and you're going to make an extra $5 in profit because that you're going to pay
1:39:20
the same price anyway so here I added that option now they still will have the free economy shipping option here but
1:39:26
they've also got Express for $4.99 so they'll still see free shipping but they will have the option to choose express
1:39:33
one or two business days for $4.99 so I'm not going to add that for now because I haven't checked the supplier
1:39:38
yet but just know that that is an option now let's create one more shipping profile from China so this way if we
1:39:44
want to ship from the us or if we want to ship from China we've got these shipping profiles already set up so in
1:39:49
order to create a new ships from location I'm going to have to click on loc here on the settings and it does
1:39:56
have my regular shop location which is the United States it's active I need to add another location on this plan okay
1:40:01
so this one I'm going to call it China Warehouse click on done and for the next
1:40:08
part we need to add an address so the address is the warehouse address doesn't need to be 100% correct doesn't need to
1:40:15
be the same exact uh uh address but it does need to be from the same country so if I'm shipping from the US it's going
1:40:21
to take my Shopify us uh Store settings that I used when I registered for my Shopify account of course I can always
1:40:27
change that here on locations but I'm good with that address if they see that as a Warehouse address again as long as
1:40:33
we are shipping from that country so if I'm saying I'm shipping from the US I can give it any Us address for the
1:40:38
warehouse and same thing for China and any other Warehouse that we create so here I'm creating a China Warehouse I
1:40:44
will need to give them a warehouse of someplace in China so one thing that we're not going to do is lie about the
1:40:51
country okay so if we're shipping from China we're not going to say that we're shipping from the US and vice versa if
1:40:56
we're shipping from the US we're not going to say that we're shipping from China no reason to do that but we're not going to do it anyway so what we're
1:41:01
going to do here is add an address in order to find an address really quick back to the Shopify Drop Shipping cheat
1:41:06
sheet I did add some locations here so you got us Warehouse addresses China Warehouse addresses UK Australia Europe
1:41:13
most of the main locations where people ship out products from so here I'm going to click on China Warehouse addresses
1:41:20
and I'm just going to copy one of these addresses inside there okay so I'm going to go again to address I'm going to
1:41:25
click on add this country now is China okay and full address so let's
1:41:32
just copy one of the addresses here again you guys can have access to all of these links inside the cheat sheet just
1:41:38
comment # Shopify what you learned about this video what you liked about it the most and I will send you it in a link
1:41:44
okay so full address something like this okay apartment suit let's say it's
1:41:50
apartment one city what is the city here
1:41:55
hey province is anui province First Option postal code I don't think I have
1:42:02
one but let's just get one poal code is it
1:42:08
b425 postal code in anhui postal code in
1:42:14
anhui okay so let's go with this one and phone number is not a must so I
1:42:20
left that blank and that's it we have an address for a China Warehouse so now we can go ahead and click on Save make sure
1:42:26
that we also fulfill online orders from this location and click on save so now we also have this as a location so once
1:42:34
we set that up under locations we can go back to shipping and delivery and create our new ships from rule so here's what
1:42:39
we already created General is not relevant us shipping is when we ship from the US to worldwide and we're going
1:42:45
to create a new profile and this one is going to be called China Warehouse or ships from China
1:42:53
products we will add later and under fulfillment locations we've got both of the options so the United States and
1:42:58
China Warehouse we don't need the United States for this one so I'm going to remove the rates for that one and we're only going to keep the China warehouse
1:43:04
now under shipping zone is where we're shipping to so we're shipping from the China warehouse and we are shipping to
1:43:10
worldwide so I'm going to choose worldwide as the zone and I'm going to
1:43:15
choose everything here by the way I think in the US I didn't choose Europe so we're going to go ahead and do that now same for North America and ocean
1:43:24
so we're going to click on done okay so we've got the Fulfillment location where we're shipping from we've got the shipping zones where we're shipping to
1:43:30
and now we need to add the rates the shipping rates how long it takes and how much we are going to charge so again the
1:43:35
shipping rate is going to be free shipping the price is going to be
1:43:41
zero and we are going to click on done and we're going to click on Save okay so
1:43:46
the profile is updated now we have both us shipping which let's just for consistency call this Us warehouse and
1:43:54
China Warehouse let's just make sure that worldwide really had all of the
1:44:02
countries so here worldwide yeah we did miss a few so we've got North America us
1:44:08
we already have them in the US policy so we don't need them there but every other country is good okay so now we're
1:44:14
completely set up with our shipping and delivery where we ship from where we ship to and all of the options so that
1:44:20
when we add products we can either connect it to the Us warehouse or to the China Warehouse or any other location
1:44:26
that we're shipping from so that is how we can get all of that done that is how we can get Warehouse addresses from
1:44:31
wherever we want to ship from and just remember the small tips remove Hawaii and Alaska from the US offer free
1:44:37
shipping always and offer expedited shipping if you want for another $4.99
1:44:42
but only after you tested your supplier and you can see that they can actually ship that quickly all right so under store locations we already went over
1:44:49
that while we were creating the shipping options so the locations is the extra ships from so we had the us as the
1:44:55
default and I added another one from China of course you can add more from other locations depending on where
1:45:01
you're shipping from if you're not sure yet move on to the next section where we talk about Drop Shipping suppliers and
1:45:06
then after you choose the supplier from the region that you want to ship from you will know where you're shipping from then you can come back and create your
1:45:12
ships from location then we've got market so we've already been there while creating the shipping in delivery the markets is where we choose what Shoppers
1:45:20
will be able to have the checkout option so if I don't have the Australian Market checked in on my Store settings and
1:45:26
somebody from Australia goes to my website they will not have the ability to add that product to their card so we
1:45:31
don't want to lose that especially if we're working with suppliers that can ship to worldwide again we're going to talk about all of these suppliers soon
1:45:37
but when we use suppliers that can ship to worldwide we really don't want to miss any of these locations we want to grab in as many sales as we can so after
1:45:45
the markets is the Shopify plan if you haven't done so yet now is the time because now we're actually going to jump
1:45:51
into the action and start having fun with our stores and before that we want to make sure that everything is set so
1:45:57
make sure that you activate your Shopify plan you can wait until after the 3 days are over once again but make sure you do
1:46:02
it before the 3 days are up even if you do it after it's fine you can but you will be locked out of your store until you do so and now since we're going to
1:46:09
jump into the action it's best to have everything set in place and now let's connect a domain name to our store so
1:46:16
our store name won't be letters and numbers. myshopify.com nobody wants that
1:46:21
it doesn't look serious it's time to connect connect a domain name but I don't want you to go out to godaddy.com
1:46:26
like most people do and register for aom website and pay whatever you need to pay for that we're going to keep it as
1:46:33
budget friendly as possible and in order to do that what we're going to do here is get a free doore domain from autods
1:46:41
so this is the part where we actually connect our stores with autods and get to work now there's a lot of things that
1:46:47
autods can give us and we're going to get to all of that soon but without automation there is no way that we're going to scale we will never have enough
1:46:54
time in the day and while you can do everything manually I would not recommend that especially when you start
1:46:59
to fill up all your day by just doing one small task instead of being able to have that automated for you while you
1:47:05
can continue growing and expanding your Drop Shipping Empire but right now what you need to know is that you're going to
1:47:11
get a free do store and if you don't want that if you want to create your own domain under your Shopify settings you're going to click on domains right
1:47:17
here you're going to click on buy new domain because you don't want this really long one and here you're going to
1:47:23
write whatever you want so for example let's say you want uh General goods.com
1:47:28
you have to search for it you have to see that it's available if not it's going to tell you what other options you
1:47:33
do have and whatever prices you're going to have to pay but guys let's save all of this money for these really ugly
1:47:39
names and get something really nice for free so instead of doing it the tedious way we are going to go with automation
1:47:46
so if you haven't done so yet click on this button right here to connect with autods and get your free store store
1:47:52
domain now your autods trial is going to cost $1 for 14 days so you're going to
1:47:58
be able to try before you buy just invest that $1 so that you can see that you're semi-serious about your business
1:48:03
before taking the next major steps and with that you're going to get a lot of things a full marketplace with private
1:48:09
suppliers and branding handpicked and trending products to help you with your product research as you've seen that's where I found my products that I will
1:48:15
sell in the store that I'm creating in this video and AD spy as you also saw when I was doing my product research
1:48:21
price and stock monitor so if the prices or the stock status changes on your suppliers websites the same changes will
1:48:27
be automatically done on your store as well so that you won't end up selling products that are not in stock and so
1:48:32
that you also won't be selling products at the wrong prices because they change on your supplier website and you didn't
1:48:37
notice and make the change on your store as well you'll also get fulfilled by autods so you can automate all of your
1:48:43
orders as well as automatic tracking number updates you've got the product imported to help you import products really quickly to your store you've got
1:48:49
product sourcing to hook you up with better suppliers better agents with faster shipping and lower prices you've
1:48:54
got the AI product title and description generator an AI store buer and print on demand and so much more I will try to
1:49:01
tackle as much as I can in this video so that you will have the whole picture of how this wonderful automation tool can
1:49:08
really help Skyrocket your business and you have the link to all of those feature pages to learn more about them
1:49:13
and the link to start your 14-day trial for just one dollar so I'm going to go ahead and click on that and I'm going to
1:49:19
click on get started now since I already have an autods account it already recognizes it you're
1:49:26
going to go through a quick registration process you're going to pay that $1 to start your 14-day trial and then you're
1:49:31
going to have to go with an autods plan and the plan that I recommend starting with is the starter 500 plan so with
1:49:37
this plan you're going to get all of the automation settings that autods has to offer as well as the ability to upload
1:49:43
500 products to your store which is more than enough to make plenty of sales and profit so that is going to cost $30 a
1:49:50
month and you're going to add that to the Shopify plan which will cost you $39 a month but only after your 1 month and
1:49:57
3-day trial so up until now we're not paying anything no expenses for the first 14 days we only paid $1 to get our
1:50:05
autods trial and $1 to Shopify to get a one- Monon trial so only after 14 days
1:50:12
the first charge will occur after that $1 which is a starter store on autods and by then we should already be making
1:50:18
sales and profit if not see it as a really small investment to get your business up and running and the next one
1:50:24
after that of course is shopify's plan after 1 month and 3 days because you did use the sign up link that we have inside
1:50:30
the Shopify Drop Shipping cheat sheet okay so once we connected with autod Ds we will be prompted to add our first
1:50:37
store so for that I'm going to click right here on ADD store and we're going to click on Shopify store now here you
1:50:44
will have the option to select do I want the system to create a pre-built AI Drop Shipping Store for me so I already
1:50:50
talked about this it doesn't cost any money it's included inside your autods plan so the only thing that you need to
1:50:56
do is click on continue but if you're creating the store if you already created one you can click here on I have
1:51:02
a Shopify store I just want to connect it to autods in my case I already have a store right I created it from scratch
1:51:08

1:51:15

1:51:20

1:51:27
the 20th time that I am a human being choose the account that you registered with and here under the
1:51:34

1:51:39

1:51:45
integration initiated for the store and the store was successfully added now I think it's time to start adding our
1:51:51
store name because we don't like seeing all these letters and numbers you could have done this at any time but I'm going to do it now so I said that I'm going
1:51:58

1:52:04

1:52:11
got my store's name but we still need a domain right the domain is still letters and numbers. myshopify.com so let's get
1:52:17

1:52:27

1:53:05
thing that it's going to ask is what store would you like to customize your domain with so before that I will give
1:53:11
my store name on autods as well cuz I made the change after I connected it to autods so I'm just going to rename this
1:53:18
store right here to Prime jungle this change is only happening inside uh
1:53:24
autods it's not happening on your store on your Shopify store okay so I'm just going to select that store so the first
1:53:30
thing that we're going to do is Select which store we would like to add that free. store domain with so right here
1:53:36
I've got a few Shopify stores connected but the one that I just renamed was Prime jungle so I'm going to click on Prime jungle and I'm going to click on
1:53:43
continue okay what is the domain that you would like to get I would like to have Prime jungle. Star now it's going
1:53:50
to check to see if it's available and I didn't get any error message so it is available but if I would have went to
1:53:55
something that is not available like for example uh prime. star then you can see that it says that domain is taken try
1:54:02
another and you are getting some options here as well so you can choose one from here or select a different domain forar
1:54:10
so this one is available Prime jungle. Star it actually has a pretty cool ring to it okay so I'm going to go ahead and
1:54:15
click on continue and enter the rest of the information name password click on
1:54:20
confirm and now they doing domain creation is in progress so first thing that it's doing is it's creating a
1:54:26
customer account under that domain name with the credentials with the information that we just filled in and
1:54:31
it is creating and connecting the domain for us so we're going to give it a couple of minutes and wait for this
1:54:36
process to finish and that is all there is to it within a couple of seconds I got my own free doar domain name and
1:54:44
that is pretty cool so let's take a look your store domain has been successfully customized domain propagation may take
1:54:50
up to 24 hours so it might not work immediately you can manage your store domain and Store settings which is where
1:54:56
we were just a minute ago inside autods to change your store domain log into yourstore domain account using the email
1:55:02
address and password you set up so here's my current store domain it's Prime jungle. store now that I
1:55:07
registered my domain the next step is to connect that domain to my Shopify store
1:55:13
so I got my own do Store free domain from autods and you're going to get this email congratulations we've gifted you
1:55:19
with a doar domain congratulations on sourcing your awesome do store domain so
1:55:24
if you're a Shopify seller your store domain is preconfigured to connect all you need to do is follow the three steps
1:55:31
to verify your ownership of Shopify you can do it following the steps here and if you click on this you're going to get
1:55:36
to this explanation right here telling you what you need to do next so it is a Shopify store you just need to car the
1:55:43
three simple steps you can find out those steps by clicking here and if I click on that it shows me the step by step so we're going to go to Shopify
1:55:49
settings domain connect existing domain and write that URL and then we're going
1:55:54
to click on verify connection now you are going to have to wait at least 24 hours from the time you register the
1:56:01
domain to when you're actually going to put it down on Shopify on the domain section which is what I'm doing now so
1:56:07
first register your do Store free domain on autods get your domain wait a day
1:56:12
come back and now do the following step so we're going to go to Shopify and we are under the settings page so let's go
1:56:19
back to the main dashboard of course it looks like this on the bottom left we're going to click on settings then we are
1:56:24
going to click here on domains and here instead of buy new domain we don't have to buy anything because we got a free
1:56:31
one so we're going to click on connect existing domain and here you're going to write that URL from that domain that you
1:56:37
registered so in my case it's Prime jungle. store click on next okay you're going to
1:56:44
see this quick little this domain requires verification so we're going to click down here on verify connection and
1:56:51
that is pretty much much it now your do store domain is automatically connected to your Shopify account so we got the
1:56:57
domain on autods for free the second thing that we had to do was wait 24 to 48 hours and then we went to Shopify we
1:57:03
clicked on settings we clicked on domains and we clicked on connect existing domain we wrote down our domain
1:57:09
information and we clicked on verify connection now if you want to have a deeper look into this you also have a
1:57:15
dashboard for your do store user configuration so it was configured while we were creating the domain you you had
1:57:21
that little field for a username and a password when you were registering for your free domain on autods so you can
1:57:26
get to that by clicking on the email that you got by the three simple steps right here that will take you to this website right here showing you what are
1:57:33
the next three steps that you need to do which I already went over so you're going to click here to see those three steps by clicking on existing domain and
1:57:40
putting the URL now if you do get a message that you need an additional txt
1:57:45
record verification after waiting 24 to 48 hours then you have a link to another
1:57:51
document right here and this simply tells you that if that happens then go to your customer control panel so here
1:57:57
you have a link to that and you can also get to that same customer control panel under autods just click on settings
1:58:05
click on Store settings make sure that your store is selected here on the left side and here you're going to be able to
1:58:10
manage your domain you won't be able to register a new one because you already have a domain on this account now it changed to manage domain and that will
1:58:16
take you to the same customer control panel and here use the same credentials that you generated when you got your
1:58:23
free domain on autods during the process of registering and then here you can go under manage orders click on list SL
1:58:31
search orders and you'll be able to see your domain right here so Prime jungle. Star domain registration and this
1:58:38
expires one year from today absolutely for free okay great and of course if we
1:58:43
pay that $5 $5 half per month the domain will stay alive forever and ever as long
1:58:48
as we need it to so again I'm going to click on domains and we can see that Prime jungle. store is now my official
1:58:55
domain my first domain that I got was this random one from Shopify and now it redirects to Prime jungle. store so that
1:59:02
is how easy it is to get your own do store domain name and now we are rocking with prime jungle. doain so I urge
1:59:10
everyone to take advantage of getting a free domain do not put money down where money is not needed and make your store
1:59:17
look as professional and be as professional as possible start raking in your Sal in profits which is what I'm
1:59:22
showing you how to do in this video and then use those profits to reinvest back into your business to having bigger
1:59:29
themes better apps and things that will help you drive more sales further down the road but you absolutely do not need
1:59:35
to spend this money right up front and I'm going to show you the best ways to do that as I've done until now so get
1:59:41
your free domain from autods well included into your $1 trial package and
1:59:47
enjoy one of the many many great things that you will be getting from the world's number one Drop Shipping
1:59:52
automation platform now that we're done with product research and creating our Shopify store and getting all of the
1:59:58
configuration and settings out of the way it is now time to find a Drop Shipping supplier that we will use to
2:00:04
Source our products from the products that we found during our product research phase Now product research is
2:00:10
something that's going to be ongoing and working with suppliers and multiple suppliers is the best way to move
2:00:16
forward so I'm going to go over everything that you need to know about Drop Shipping suppliers and where to get the best ones for your business business
2:00:22
now there's a lot of terminology when it comes to drop shipping suppliers there are retail suppliers Hotel suppliers 3pl
2:00:28
service providers private Drop Shipping suppliers I'm going to go through all of them with the pros and the cons of each
2:00:34
and you'll be able to make the best decision for your store so first of all let's start by talking about what are
2:00:39
the most important things to look for in a Drop Shipping supplier and this will help us choose the best ones that will
2:00:45
suit our needs so what we want to look for in a Drop Shipping supplier is first of all we want to make sure that they
2:00:50
have fast shipping and deliv y times customers do not want to wait 3 to 4 weeks we are done with that time this is
2:00:57
not 2014 today customers want their products as fast as possible they want it
2:01:04
yesterday they put the order in today but they expect to get it by yesterday so we're going to find suppliers that
2:01:09
can ship out really quickly and have fast delivery times next we want to work with suppliers that work with major
2:01:15
shipping carriers and so that way we are going to get reliable tracking information and by reliable suppliers
2:01:20
I'm talking about all the big big Brands all the big companies that are known worldwide and by good shipping carriers
2:01:26
I'm talking about examples like FedEx UPS USPS DHL and all of those major
2:01:32
shipping carriers which I'm sure you've heard of before so once they work with major shipping carriers we are going to
2:01:37
get reliable tracking information and that way we're going to avoid refunding customers that open up INR claims or in
2:01:44
other words item not received cases so if they reach out to you and they're like hey I didn't get my product can you
2:01:50
send me a refund or send me a replacement so what you're going to do here is you're going to look at the tracking information from that order and
2:01:56
you're going to see what the status is but if your supplier is not working with major shipping carriers and the tracking information is not trackable you will
2:02:03
not be able to prove this to the customer that it was delivered and you will have to end up sending them a refund without actually getting one
2:02:09
yourself so to avoid situations like this and to keep our customer service at Top Notch which is really important for
2:02:15
the long-term survivability of our business we want to make sure that we have tracking information that's trackable to avoid ref funding INR
2:02:22
claims and to have peace of mind at the end of the day the next thing that we want to look for in a Drop Shipping supplier is good return policies what do
2:02:30
I mean by good we want to be able to give our customers the chance to return the item if there's something wrong with
2:02:36
it if they don't like it if it's damaged if the shipping box was damaged or if there were some pieces that were missing
2:02:43
from the order so we want to be looking for suppliers that have good return policies so this way if our buyer
2:02:48
reaches out to us and they're like hey I want to return the item we are going to to turn over to our supplier and be like hey our customer wants to return the
2:02:55
product now some suppliers simply do not allow returns we will try to avoid working with such suppliers again you
2:03:01
can still sell products that do not allow returns but you'll have a much higher chance and much more sales on
2:03:07
products where customers do have that peace of mind that they can return the product if there's something wrong with it now don't be startled by returns this
2:03:14
should make up between one to maybe 2% of your business as long as we're selling high quality products and we're
2:03:20
working with high quality suppliers all of which we are getting into in this video but still we want to keep that down to a minimum so some suppliers are
2:03:26
not going to allow returns but other suppliers and most suppliers and those that we are going to work with will allow us to open up return cases now
2:03:34
some suppliers want the buyer to pay for the return no matter what the reason is and some suppliers will be like hey you
2:03:40
know what I'll pay for the return label the supplier will pay for it if it's their fault or the buyer will pay for it
2:03:47
if they just regret putting in the order and they don't really want the item and other suppliers will allow returns no
2:03:53
questions asked if the buyer wants to return they simply can without giving any reason whatsoever so all in all we
2:03:58
want to look for a supplier with good return policies anywhere between 14 to 30-day returns preferably paid by the
2:04:06
seller SL supplier so the supplier will reimburse you and you will reimburse your customer once the item is returned
2:04:12
next we want to look for a supplier that has good communication so what does this mean when we reach out to our suppliers
2:04:18
we want to make sure that they are responsive and that they don't take a few days or a week to answer because
2:04:24
that means that it's going to take us a few days or weeks to answer our customers and that is bad customer
2:04:30
service right there and one of the most crucial things that I believe kept me in the business for eight years and running
2:04:35
is that I put customer service at the top of my priorities and I never had to send a refund without getting one myself
2:04:42
I never had to make a decision that was unfair to me but on the other hand I'm always communicative with my buyers I
2:04:48
never argue with them and I always give them what they one in the end as long as their claims of course are correct but
2:04:55
again I do not get into arguments with them and any return that I have any claim that my customers have I always
2:05:01
walk them hand inand and that comes with fast communication so we want to make sure that our suppliers respond to us
2:05:07
quickly so that we can respond quickly to our customers as well but also provide good solutions to their issues
2:05:13
now this should probably go without saying but we want to look for suppliers that have high quality products we do
2:05:18
not want to sell products that are broken damage or that customers simply do not
2:05:24
want or do not like so how do we know if our suppliers have high quality products we can always go to their website and
2:05:30
see if they have a website and read customer reviews for example if we're working with retailers I'm going to get to the whole terminology soon but if
2:05:36
you're working with a retailer like Amazon which is not a private supplier or a wholesale or anything but over
2:05:42
there you can read product reviews or AliExpress or any other retailer you can usually read customer reviews from
2:05:47
people who actually purchase those products you can also look for customer reviews for people who are actually working with that supplier and slash or
2:05:55
you can simply order a product from one of these suppliers get them delivered to your address and simply check the
2:06:00
product yourself this is also going to give you another reason to do organic marketing and shoot videos on the
2:06:05
product and start gaining some organic traffic all of which I will get to in the marketing section of this video and I will do it myself as well you guys
2:06:11
will be able to see exactly what I'm selling you'll see all of my strategies I'll show you how I do my organic videos and everything else anyways we'll get to
2:06:18
that soon so high quality products is something that we are looking for for and we can do that by seeing the
2:06:23
customer reviews or by ordering the products to our addresses and checking them ourselves last but not least we do
2:06:29
not want to put all of our eggs in one basket in other words we do not want to work with only one Drop Shipping
2:06:34
supplier even if they have millions of products and they're all trendy and they're all making a sales we always
2:06:40
want to have a backup supplier or at least a few backup suppliers so if for any reason one supplier starts to either
2:06:46
slow down on their response time or running out of stock or are out on certain holidays and Seasons like if
2:06:52
you're working with a Chinese supplier and then there's Chinese holidays which are not aligned with yours they're going to have some off time sometimes even for
2:06:58
a couple of weeks a few times throughout the year and you are going to have to put up with that and understand that now no one is going to ship out your orders
2:07:05
so you want to work with multiple suppliers so that if one ever lets you down you can always rely on the other
2:07:10
and so those are all of the important things of what to look for in a Drop Shipping supplier now before I give you
2:07:15
the list of the best Drop Shipping suppliers and walk you through each and every one of them I want you to understand the differences between a a
2:07:21
private supplier a retail and a wholesale supplier so let's start with retail and wholesale some examples like
2:07:27
that as I mentioned retailers are like Amazon AliExpress Walmart Home Depot and
2:07:33
all of those other big branded websites those are retail suppliers and there are simply retailers looking to sell to the
2:07:40
UN customer and we as drop shippers come in the middle between the supplier the retailer and the End customer we buy the
2:07:47
product from the retailer once we get an order and we ship it to the End customer now this has been the traditional method
2:07:53
called Arbitrage which has been going on for a very very long time now and it's still working really well today for
2:07:59
thousands and thousands of drop shippers but on the other hand it comes with its cons it comes with its disadvantages
2:08:05
because some retailers simply do not want you to drop ship from them now does that mean that you cannot drop ship from
2:08:11
them not really but they don't want you to do it and they will try to enforce some strict rules sometimes like for
2:08:17
example did you know that Amazon will lock your buyer account after fulfilling lots of orders to multiple addresses
2:08:24
because they simply do not want you to do that now I will show you workarounds to that later in this video when we get to the order fulfillment section but
2:08:31
that is some of the things that we have to deal with when working with big retailers that do not want to work with drop shippers now on the other hand we
2:08:37
do have wholesale suppliers but that is kind of problematic because most wholesale suppliers want to sell
2:08:43
products in bulk so they will not sell a product to you if you're only going to buy one unit they want to sell to you at
2:08:49
wholesale prices meaning that you're going to going to have to order a minimum order quantity in order to purchase their products at a certain
2:08:55
price now on the other hand you do have wholesale suppliers that do work with drop shippers now there are a few examples like that like Alibaba which is
2:09:02
also a manufacturer but they're not directly the manufacturer they work with the wholesale suppliers and some of
2:09:07
those wholesale suppliers even work with drop shippers especially if you look for the ready to ship option from Alibaba
2:09:13
and those are products that have already been manufactured and some of them do sell at a minimum order quantity of one
2:09:19
others will sell at anq of 5 or 10 and up but you can still find products that you can drop ship one by one just take
2:09:26
note of the shipping price because sometimes that can get pretty high but on the other hand you do have wholesale suppliers that can work with you it's
2:09:33
just a little bit more difficult than working with a traditional retail and private suppliers and my personal
2:09:38
favorite is private Drop Shipping suppliers I believe that this is the perfect solution for any drop shipper
2:09:44
whether you're a beginner you're a novice or you've been at it for a few years by now private suppliers is the
2:09:49
future and that is the way to go now people have been having a hard time finding these private suppliers how do I
2:09:56
get to them how do I find them how do I reach them and how do I build and maintain a good relationship with them
2:10:01
because when you are working with a private agent with a private supplier you're getting a huge benefit over 99%
2:10:07
of other drop shippers who are not working with private suppliers because their products you cannot find on Amazon
2:10:13
or Walmart or Google or anywhere else they've got access to products that other suppliers simply do not have now
2:10:19
of course some products you can find them in other places but you will have a list of products that will be great for your business sometimes other suppliers
2:10:25
can run out of stock and your private suppliers will still have but it's not only that it's the relationship that you
2:10:31
can build with these private suppliers it's the fact that they are looking they're waiting they're thirsty and
2:10:36
hungry to work with drop shippers such as yourselves they give better customer support because they are working with
2:10:42
you oneon-one instead of having some customer service chat from someone in another country talk to you like when
2:10:48
you're reaching out to Amazon's customer support or Al Express and so forth here you're talking with the actual supplier
2:10:54
and they will do everything in their power to help you because you are both shaking each other's hands you're making their businesses better they're making
2:11:01
your business better and this is the way that we make it work so we build and maintain healthy relationships with
2:11:07
private suppliers that nobody else has access to and that way we're getting faster shipping times we're getting better prices we're getting trending
2:11:14
products to sell in our stores and we really don't have to worry about anything or reasons that we do have to
2:11:19
worry when working with retail or wholesale suppliers so in my opinion private suppliers is the way to go but
2:11:25
like I said we are going to work with multiple suppliers so we can work with multiple private suppliers we can work with private and Retail suppliers at the
2:11:32
same time and kind of test the waters and see what is the best for our business we'll never know until we actually dip our feet inside get started
2:11:39
take action and start Gathering data to learn how we can further multiply our success and avoid future failures so
2:11:45
what is the list of the best Drop Shipping suppliers the first one shouldn't be a secret is the autods
2:11:52
marketplace now I've already mentioned it somewhere in this video around the beginning but autods does have private
2:11:58
Drop Shipping suppliers and it's inside the autods marketplace and one of the things that I love about these private
2:12:04
suppliers is the fact that we're actually getting customized branding with these products now this is a new
2:12:09
thing for the Drop Shipping business model because no supplier would ever give you customized branding to your
2:12:15
products when you are ordering just one unit each time they're going to ask you hey if you want us to send your products
2:12:21
out with your logo with your brand then you're going to have to at least order 50 or 100 units so that it will be
2:12:27
worthwhile for us to do it but now with autod DS's private suppliers you're actually going to get that even when
2:12:33
you're purchasing orders one by one because that is a Drop Shipping business model we're not going to have anq so now
2:12:40
we can get customized branding and that is really good for The Branding effect of our stores next we've got the autods
2:12:45
warehouse also inside the marketplace so we also have our own Warehouse in China where we ship goods within a week to the
2:12:52
US and worldwide so the shipping time is really quick even though it's coming from China we work with high quality
2:12:58
shipping carriers we've got great return policies and that warehouse is simply full of trending products with our years
2:13:04
and years of experience and with our ever growing database we're able to bring you the best products and best
2:13:09
shipping times from that warehouse and you've also got more advantages so let's just go ahead and jump inside and show
2:13:15
you what it looks like so this right here is the autods marketplace and and
2:13:21
you have access to this as long as you create an autods account so if you're even on your $1 14-day trial you have
2:13:27
access to the marketplace and you can start working with private suppliers so what are all these products and which
2:13:33
suppliers are they coming from so right now since we don't have any filters going on this is coming from a bunch of
2:13:39
random suppliers some can be retail some can be wholesale and some can be private how do we know by simply looking at the
2:13:45
supplier's name right here so this one is called lppf store this one is called Jeff store these are private suppliers
2:13:52
but if you're going to see something like uh Amazon or AliExpress or uh Target or any other retail supplier that
2:13:58
autods works with then you're going to see their names here but mostly all I'm seeing right now is private suppliers
2:14:04
which is great so what are the first things that we can do we can click up here on the top right under supplier and
2:14:09
here for example if I click like let's say dhgate so that's a retailer or maybe
2:14:14
better yet this one is a wholesaler so here for example we can see all of the products that are coming from dhgate now
2:14:20
these seller names inside are not private suppliers they are sellers inside dhgate who are selling those
2:14:26
products because dhgate is a Marketplace so it could be the same for the supplier names that we saw here so at the end how
2:14:32
do you know if you're looking at private suppliers the filter that you want to choose here is autods suppliers and now
2:14:38
you're going to see all of the private suppliers so some as you already know is the autods warehouse as we can see right
2:14:44
here and the others are other private suppliers like we've got Tasha apparel right here and if I click on her name I
2:14:51
can see other products that she sells and you can see that she is a private fashion supplier so this is for the
2:14:57
fashion Niche and you can simply sell all of these products on your store and again these are not products that you
2:15:02
can find in any other Marketplace if I search it for on Amazon or AliExpress or any other I may find those that are
2:15:09
similar to it but you will most likely not see the same exact one unless they ordered in bulk and transported it to
2:15:15
their warehouse so you can see the different variations and more information on the product like how fast
2:15:20
it takes to ship out and as you can see this one right here ships from the United States so that is great
2:15:26
especially if you are also shipping to the United States so here we're shipping from and to the US and the shipping time
2:15:31
is within four to six business days so that is absolutely wonderful we can get this mustard yellow shirt to our
2:15:37
customers addresses within the week so here we've got the product information and the policy so returns are prohibited
2:15:45
for this product she does not accept returns and that's probably because it's a fashion is which is a little bit problematic when it comes to returns
2:15:52
some suppliers simply will not allow it okay so that's just one example let's look at another private suppliers
2:15:58
example so again we're going to hover over suppliers and we're going to click on autods suppliers and now let's look
2:16:03
at another one so let's see the autods warehouse for example I'm going to click on that so I'll see all the products
2:16:08
coming from the auto Zs warehouse and yeah let's let's you know let's stay on that product for a bit it looks good
2:16:14
it's it's pretty good for Drop Shipping so this men's body shaper W waist trainer so if I click on on it we can
2:16:21
see that the shipping here is 11 to 14 business days so about 2 weeks this is pretty much the maximum you do not want
2:16:27
it to be more than 2 weeks but most likely it's not going to take this long most likely will get delivered within
2:16:33
the week try it out order it to your house and see now if this is too much of course you can go to the cheaper ones
2:16:38
but here is the products information so again you've got all the images and if you've got more variations you'll see them here like the black and you've got
2:16:44
the blue variation and single Velcro so you've got all of these product variations and you've got all of these
2:16:50
sizes from small all the way up to Triple XL we know that it ships from China and we've got more product
2:16:56
information as we continue to scroll down the product size is really really important make sure to have that on your
2:17:02
product listing if you are selling such products that people need to wear and that way they can make sure that the
2:17:08
measurements are correct so you got all the product information here and if you want to add it to your store simply click on this import draft button right
2:17:14
here and boom within a few seconds you are selling this product on your store so very nice very convenient and it's
2:17:20
nice to kind of have everything in one place and another great thing about the private suppliers on the autods
2:17:26
marketplace is the fact that we can fulfill all of our orders easily and automatically using the fulfilled by
2:17:32
autods service now I will explain how to opt into that and what comes with it later on in the order section of this
2:17:38
video but I want you to know that any time you get an order from one of these
2:17:44
private suppliers it will be fulfilled using the fulfilled by autods service so you do not need to worry about opening
2:17:50
up buyer account accounts with multiple suppliers like going to AliExpress and making a buyer account there and putting
2:17:55
your credit card information and sending for Amazon or any supplier that you want to work with here you can work with
2:18:02
multiple private Drop Shipping suppliers and all of the payments for their orders will all be done within the autods
2:18:09
system so you do not need to give them your payment information it will all be done using your fulfilled by autods
2:18:15
balance so again more on that later on but that's another significant Advantage when work working with autod DS's
2:18:21
private suppliers so we have it all in one place we do not need to go outside and we do not need to have multiple
2:18:28
payment information with multiple suppliers so we've got the marketplace with all of the private suppliers and
2:18:33
the retail ones whichever ones you want to work with you import them really quickly to your store and just look at the shipping time for some of these
2:18:39
products look at this backpack right here shipping time one business day so this is a back pack from A supplier
2:18:45
called holy party let's click on him and get more info about him so here I can see that his main Niche is probably the
2:18:53
outdoors he doesn't have too many products but just because he has that fast shipping time especially for these
2:18:59
two bags right here one and two business days that is really really good so I would definitely consider trying this
2:19:05
one out so I'm going to click on that and let's also see what his policies are you can see that he does offer returns
2:19:11
so return window 30 days so he will allow your customer to return the product return paid by the buyer and we
2:19:18
can see that this one comes with free shipping to the United States shipping and processing time just one business
2:19:24
day absolutely wonderful and we've got two different colored variations so we can go with gray or blue and you can
2:19:30
also see how many reviews this product got from the review rating to the amount of reviews so absolutely great we can
2:19:36
get an idea of whether this supplier is a good one or not now another thing that you can do with these private suppliers
2:19:43
is you can send them messages so if I click on autods suppliers again let's go to another private supplier let's go to
2:19:51
for example let's just look for another product that looks interesting what is
2:19:57
this automatic brush cleaner so besides the fact that this is also going to help you find great products to sell so it
2:20:04
also helps you with your product research cuz these suppliers know what works they're not going to sell you products that are not selling cuz they
2:20:09
need to also make sales and profit so especially suppliers that have a lot of experience in the field already you
2:20:14
won't know until you start messaging them ordering from them and simply start communicating and get to action so here
2:20:21
you've got an option message this supplier so let's say I've got something to say about this product or I've got
2:20:28
something to ask the supplier I want to know what shipping carriers they work with or have any other question or I
2:20:33
simply want to build a relationship with them so here what we can do is under the shipping and processing time which is
2:20:39
great for this product 4 to6 days you've got this button message this supplier so if I click on that it opens up an
2:20:45
internal chat between me and that private supplier so this supplier calls themselves the perfect part Inc so here
2:20:51
I could say Hello nice to meet you I would like to start Drop Shipping your
2:20:58
products may I know which shipping carriers you work with and let's say and
2:21:06
if there are additional products you haven't added to autods yet just to know
2:21:13
if there's more products that are incoming again this is just an example so I clicked on send and now you can see that it sent the message so right now I
2:21:20
can see that the supplier is offline so I will just wait to see how long it takes them to respond which is one of the things that we're looking for and of
2:21:27
course if their answers are relevant to our questions so that way we can get an idea of who we are working with or who
2:21:33
we are about to work with so that's going to give us another significant advantage over the competition of other
2:21:38
drop shippers who are not connected to private suppliers now there's another way to connect with private suppliers
2:21:44
and that is through product sourcing and I'm going to show you that when we get to the order fulfillment section of this
2:21:49
video and remember how I mentioned customized branding so that we're also going to get through these private
2:21:55
suppliers so that is only available on products where you see here in the marketplace that it says customizable
2:22:02
branding so like this one has it from the autods warehouse all of the products from the autods warehouse have customizable branding but we can see
2:22:08
that Tasha here does not have it but other ones like Levi Ling here that
2:22:13
sells nice pet supplies nice pet products does have customizable branding and so anyways every supplier where we
2:22:20
see that it has it if we click on it then here on the right side of the product page you'll have a create your
2:22:26
customizable branding option and what you're going to do here is you're going to click on ADD now and that will take
2:22:32
you to the settings SL Store settings section of your store and this is the same place where we created our free.art
2:22:39
domain so if we just scroll down a bit we can see The Branding settings section here and this is where you are going to
2:22:45
click to upload or just drag and drop the logo or the image that you would like to set out with those products from
2:22:52
the private suppliers that have customizable branding so in this case I did upload an autods logo so any product
2:22:59
that I sell through the private suppliers that have customizable branding they will get sent out with the
2:23:04
autods logo and this is how you're going to customize your products and those products are going to get sent out with
2:23:10
your store logo on the site and again that is going to do a great job on The Branding effect of your store even if
2:23:16
you're a drop shipper and you're not some huge big brand at least not yet yet so that is my number one recommendation
2:23:23
work inside the autods marketplace we've put so much work into getting these suppliers there are new suppliers that
2:23:29
we are accepting all the time and of course they are going through a vetting process so we check them we validate
2:23:35
them we see that they're good with their services and that at the end of the day they will help you make more sales and
2:23:41
be able to provide better customer support and faster shipping for your products the next best Drop Shipping
2:23:47
supplier is the 30 plus other Drop Shipping suppliers that are supported by autods now I will show you other options
2:23:54
soon if you are not working with autods or if you just want to check out other options I will still show you all of the
2:23:59
methods so that you can take whatever route you want but of course this is going to be my best recommendation
2:24:04
because I have years and years of experience with this and I simply find it the easiest way to build and automate
2:24:10
my business so autods supports over 30 suppliers and again more are being added
2:24:16
all the time now when we were just starting out we only had a couple but now you can see the full list right here
2:24:22
so from AliExpress all the way to autods with the private suppliers but of course
2:24:27
you've got other suppliers here that you can use like eBay Etsy you can use Shopify as a supplier but not if you're
2:24:33
using Shopify as a selling channel so some of these suppliers can also be used as selling channels but you cannot have
2:24:38
the same supplier as the same selling channel so for example I can use eBay as a supplier and drop ship products that I
2:24:45
see on eBay to my Shopify store or any other one of these suppliers so these
2:24:50
supported suppliers means that all of the automation is included inside the fast product importing which I will show
2:24:56
you soon price and stock monitoring automatic orders fulfilled by autods which is the automated order service
2:25:02
that I will also talk to you soon which will not use your buyer account so it'll make automation much more easier when it
2:25:07
comes to order processing and other automation tools that we have set up in the system so all of the automation can
2:25:13
be used with all of these suppliers this means that you can grab tens of millions of products from these retailers SL
2:25:20
wholesalers and drop ship them on your Shopify store and soon with the import options that I will show you you'll see
2:25:26
how easy it is to be able to grab single or multiple products and import them to your store in seconds so take advantage
2:25:33
of all of the Drop Shipping suppliers that you can use whether it's going to be retail wholesale or private
2:25:39
dropshipping suppliers all of which is supported 100% by autod DS's automation
2:25:45
features okay so next is Aliexpress now this is a retail supplier and we could
2:25:50
have also talked about it here because they're also a supported supplier uh by autods but I do kind of put that on the
2:25:58
side because you can use them as a supplier or at least as a source for
2:26:03
finding products and then sourcing those through other suppliers and if this is kind of confusing to you don't worry
2:26:09
just stick with me because I'm going to walk you through everything but you can use AliExpress as a supplier as well now
2:26:15
I can tell you that 90% of drop shippers Who start Drop Shipping all start with Alex press just cuz it's really easy you
2:26:22
just sign in create an account it's free and then just add those products to your store and when they sell you just go to
2:26:28
AliExpress buy them and ship them to your customer it's really easy and AliExpress works really really well with drop shippers but on the other hand they
2:26:35
have a whole bunch of Sellers and some of them are not good not reliable and not everyone does their due diligence to
2:26:41
research and do homework on the sellers inside Ali Express that they are working with and there's another catch on
2:26:47
AliExpress most of these people most of these sellers on AliExpress are drop shippers themselves they're simply
2:26:53
Chinese drop shippers that are purchasing products or listing products for sale from Chinese retailers which
2:27:01
you and I do not have access to because we don't know Chinese and we don't go to those websites like taow and other big
2:27:08
Chinese marketplaces so they simply take products from there and list it on their AliExpress store and when you purchase
2:27:13
from them they purchase from the retailer and ship it to your customer to the to your address details that you put
2:27:20
on AliExpress that it's funny how the whole world is kind of Drop Shipping from one to another so that's why I
2:27:26
don't really use them as my supplier but I do use them as a source so again we're going to dive deep into that but here
2:27:33
for example I just searched for umbrella and here we have a whole bunch of results on AliExpress for umbrella and
2:27:38
we're not just looking for your ordinary umbrella that you can find in a local store you want to find one with nice features and things like that but again
2:27:45
we're not doing product research right now we are looking for good sellers on AliExpress so one way to do it to see
2:27:50
how many times the product sold which you can get the information right down here it's pretty simple but you want to
2:27:55
do more research on the supplier itself so you can click on the supplier store right here so this one is called neang
2:28:01
go store or if you're inside the product page you can also do it from the product page so here I am on the product page
2:28:07
I'm just going to scroll down click on store and here I'm getting his Store settings so he only has two followers
2:28:13
he's probably relatively new but his feedback score is pretty high but I already clicked on his store from the
2:28:20
search page and here I'm just getting more products but when I hover over his name I can get more information so here
2:28:26
I can see that he sold over 8,000 units I see that he's got a 97.2 positive
2:28:32
review rating and he has over 200 regular buyers now he has been around for just under a year I would look for
2:28:39
sellers who have been on the platform for at least a year so it's not just someone new he's kind of coming in testing the waters making mistakes and
2:28:46
then just leaving AliExpress closing his account and leaving you high and dry with your buyers so that is a case that happens from time to time and we do want
2:28:52
to learn to research our Sellers and make sure that we know who we're working with so these stats are definitely going
2:28:57
to help us and this is a seller that I would be confident in choosing and selecting some of their products for my
2:29:04
store so you want to do your supplier research on AliExpress as well now there's a new link on AliExpress I don't
2:29:11
know how long it's going to be up for so go check it out now it's called ships
2:29:16
from us and this again is going to help you ship quickly from into the us if the
2:29:22
US is your target audience and we want to do that because again customers do not want to wait a long time to get their products so if I click on ships
2:29:28
from us it's going to take me to AliExpress's Us warehouse and as we can see right here free shipping 2 to eight
2:29:34
days delivery so that's what all of the US customers and other customers are looking for right fast delivery and of
2:29:40
course free now like I mentioned even if you're going to pay for shipping you're still going to offer free shipping to your buyers we're going to get to the
2:29:45
whole pricing section in this video as well but let's take a look at some of these products so all of these ship from
2:29:51
the US so let's see some of these products that ship from the US Warehouse
2:29:57
okay so let's say this three tier rolling cabinet over here so if I click on it going to go to the product page
2:30:03
okay and here you've got free shipping and delivery within the week and I want to check which shipping carrier they use
2:30:09
so this is what you want to do if you're going to choose AliExpress as a supplier and you're going to their Us warehouse
2:30:14
so you're going to click on this free shipping over here and here I can see that it ships for free with FedEx GR so
2:30:20
that is great and this way we know that tracking information is going to be available it's going to be trackable and
2:30:25
if anything happens with the order of the customer say that they did not get the product or what's the status of the delivery you can always check it by
2:30:32
checking out the FedEx tracking number okay so here we validated that we can sell this product and it chips from the
2:30:38
US it arrives quickly the price is good and we've got trackable tracking info let's take a look at one more example so
2:30:44
let's say this Clos steamer over here and let's say we already did the store validation we went to the seller store
2:30:52
and we saw that they have a lot of positive reviews so I wouldn't go with anyone that has a 94% and below so we
2:30:58
want to make sure it's 95 and above in the positive ratings and like I mentioned they need to be at least or
2:31:04
around a year active on AliExpress and of course lots of reviews not just one or two reviews okay so here we've also
2:31:11
got free shipping and this is also from FedEx so that is great now you've also got UPS so if you want to work with UPS
2:31:18
no extra cost just click on up ups and it'll ship with UPS same with USPS and
2:31:23
so forth but I do want you to check this out because sometimes the first shipping carrier from the US on AliExpress is not
2:31:29
some big known carrier and you're going to have to choose the second or third one which in most cases is absolutely
2:31:35
free and you will have FedEx or another major shipping carrier as the option so make sure that you check that out when
2:31:41
using AliExpress as a supplier and you're checking out their ships from Us warehouse again I've dropped links to
2:31:47
everything that I'm talking about inside the Shopify Drop Shipping cheat sheet don't go anywhere we still got a lot
2:31:53
more to cover in this video but make sure that when you're taking breaks you know exactly where you stopped and you can come back you can even use the time
2:32:00
stamps below to jump to the section where you left off on but again if you want access to this cheat sheet all you
2:32:06
have to do is comment down below # Shopify let me know what is your top takeaway from this video what did you
2:32:11
learn and I will send you the link to this cheat sheet with all of the links inside okay so the next thing that I
2:32:16
love about AliExpress is the AliExpress Drop Shipping Center now this has went through some changes recently and I did
2:32:22
go over it in the product research section so I'm not going to do it again but you have your fine products to sell
2:32:28
you have your product analysis where you have to put the URL and it'll show you similar products that are selling and how well they're doing so this kind of
2:32:34
helps you with product research and it is good to have a supplier that also kind of helps you with product research so here are some of the prerequisites
2:32:41
that I mentioned to look out for when you are looking for a good supplier to use within AliExpress another thing that
2:32:46
you can do there is try to contact them right send them a message Mage to see how fast they reply to you same as when
2:32:52
you're working with autods private suppliers or other suppliers that you want to work with just not retailers
2:32:57
don't message Amazon and let them know that you want not talk to them privately somewhere else because that's not the
2:33:02
way that that works so anyway try to get them on WhatsApp or WeChat and that way you can start talking to them privately
2:33:08
and not within the AliExpress platform and that way they're going to be more available and more communicative but
2:33:13
some of them don't really speak English that well and we don't really want a language barrier so make sure that you're reaching out to your supp buyers
2:33:20
and you're actually trying to communicate with them and see how fast they answer and how well their English is you can also negotiate with them for
2:33:26
better deals and slowly build relationships and get winning product Trends and that is using AliExpress as a
2:33:32
supplier remember that AliExpress is a retailer they're not a private supplier or anything like that next you've got
2:33:37
worldwide Brands so this is another option especially if you want to do manual work and you don't want to add
2:33:43
Automation in or you kind of want to mix manual with automation so personally I do not work with Worldwide Brands but I
2:33:50
know some drop shippers who do so I was able to get some of the best tips from them and what I did learn from worldwide
2:33:57
Brands is that they do have a large Drop Shipping suppliers database but on the other hand you do have to check them one
2:34:03
by one because some of these suppliers are outdated or not in business anymore
2:34:08
and I think the biggest takeaway here is that it does cost $197 to get access to this private
2:34:16
directory so that is a pretty big sum of money to put down especially since you have a lot more work to do after that
2:34:23
but again there are drop shippers who work with Worldwide Brands they're able to find some suppliers using their huge
2:34:28
list of suppliers and you can see that they've got a Drop Shipping section over here so here they're kind of talking to
2:34:34
drop shippers and they're like hey if you're selling on eBay or Amazon or an eore in other words Shopify so you want
2:34:41
to work with high quality suppliers and blah blah blah I think it would have been nice if they gave some examples on some suppliers that they can kind of
2:34:47
hook you up with maybe if we click on free preview over here yeah you can sign up for a free preview but again they're
2:34:53
kind of giving you trade shows which is not really relevant educational selling online articles I mean it might not be
2:34:59
that great get scam-free recommendations and we will never sell or give away your email address okay great so you can go
2:35:06
ahead and see a free preview I don't think they're going to hook you up with any suppliers yet so like I said I did
2:35:12
add this as another option because there are drop shippers who work with them but just make sure that you understand the
2:35:18
ins and the outs so on the hand you are going to get a huge list and you're going to have to start getting to work on that list and looking at those
2:35:24
suppliers seeing what they have to offer and some of these suppliers you can also find on Google so what you can do if
2:35:30
you're down for all the manual work is let's say you want to work in the uh Home and Garden Niche or you want to
2:35:36
find a supplier for Home and Garden so you would search Google for Home and Garden manufacturer okay or wholeseller
2:35:44
you got to start from somewhere right and then you have these places like better homes in Garden so you can kind of reach out to them I wouldn't really
2:35:50
reach out to Walmart it's just a huge retailer they're not going to work with uh drop shippers but again there's a whole bunch of suppliers that you're
2:35:56
going to see here and most of them are not going to be good with drop shippers they will want you to order a minimum
2:36:01
order quantity you'll have to do a lot of work here to kind of narrow down and find those suppliers that can work with
2:36:08
you as a drop shipper so worldwide Brands and simply searching Google for your Niche searching for manufacturers
2:36:14
you can also try to sell for wholesale suppliers but that's going to give you a lot of suppliers that will want you to have anq and you do have 3pl so 3pl
2:36:22
requires an investment and that is why we do not work with that because in Drop Shipping we are trying to keep it budget
2:36:28
friendly and we want the money to come in as much as possible before money starts to go out we want to enjoy our
2:36:34
profits and we want to make a lowrisk and high reward business so 3pl is
2:36:39
thirdparty logistics it requires an investment because this is someone who will handle the Fulfillment for you and
2:36:45
this means that you'll have to store units at their warehouse so you find a 3pl service provider that has a
2:36:51
warehouse preferably in the same location that you're selling in so let's say us to us so you're going to find a
2:36:56
Us 3pl warehouse service provider and you are going to ship the goods to them and they're going to ship it out to your
2:37:02
customers when you send them those orders so you can send it one by one but you did buy the products in advance so
2:37:07
that is kind of risky you're going to have to put down a lot of money and if the products don't sell you're kind of stuck with a lot of products on the
2:37:13
shelf and that of course is no return for your expenses and that could easily slow down your business so this does
2:37:20
require that investment but you can get better prices because you are purchasing in bulk but again this is not
2:37:25
recommended for beginners there are a lot of drop shippers who do use the hybrid model they start by Drop Shipping
2:37:30
and once they find Winners that sell for them all year long year after year they do consider purchasing those products in
2:37:36
bulk so that when and if the supplier Runs Out they'll still have stock and they'll also get a better price for it
2:37:42
and this way they're continuing to do product research with droping because it's practically free and when they're
2:37:47
getting results on their product research they're ordering some of those products to their stock so this why
2:37:52
they're always using Drop Shipping for product research and ordering stock for their 3pl providers when they find their
2:37:58
clear winners now remember whatever method you choose be communicative with your suppliers if you're doing it
2:38:04
manually if you're doing it from worldwide Brands if you're doing it from Google search on private suppliers or a supplier under your Niche or a
2:38:11
manufacturer or a wholesaler reach out to them first things first let them know that you're a drop shipper and that you
2:38:16
would like to drop ship their goods and then ask your list of questions depending on that supplier and what your questions may be but do not work with
2:38:22
them automatically without reaching out and without understanding who they are and what they can actually offer to your
2:38:28
business unless of course you're working with retailers then everything is pretty much automatic just grab the product import it to your store and once you
2:38:34
sell it purchase the product send it to your end customer so it really depends on that supplier now to help you out
2:38:39
even more on narrowing down on your best Drop Shipping suppliers I do have a list
2:38:44
right here inside the Shopify cheat sheet on the best Drop Shipping suppliers for specific niches and
2:38:50
regions so here you have a list depending on the niche or depending on the region that you want to sell to and
2:38:56
from so for example you've got the best jewelry Drop Shipping suppliers here you have both wholesale and Retail suppliers
2:39:02
you've got clothing Drop Shipping suppliers Drop Shipping gifts in the UK Drop Shipping clothes in the UK candle
2:39:08

2:39:14
medical supplies Drop Shipping suppliers lingerie Drop Shipping suppliers Florida Drop Shipping suppliers pet Drop
2:39:19

2:39:26
full article with a video embedded inside on the best Drop Shipping suppliers under that specific Niche or
2:39:32
region so here for example we've got the drop shiing jewelry supplier so if you want jewelry to be your Niche you've got
2:39:38
a long long list with an embedded video inside so if you want to watch you can watch if you want to read just go ahead
2:39:44

2:39:51
about them the pros and the cons what to look out for and of course all of the
2:39:56
recommendations so you can see right here from the left side that the list is pretty big we've got both wholesale and
2:40:03
Retail suppliers and you can simply click on one of them to go straight down to that supplier and read more about
2:40:09
them so you've got again the whole list on the cheat sheet again # Shopify what you learned what is your favorite part
2:40:15
about this video and this cheat sheet is completely yours to have so let's WP wrap up the supplier section before we
2:40:21
start to import products to our stores and the reason that we look for suppliers now is first we had to do our
2:40:27
product research we had to get our store up and running and before we start adding products to our stores we want to
2:40:32
look for the best suppliers to Source them from that is why we are doing that now and that is why the next step is
2:40:38
going to be to import products to our Shopify stores that will be followed by marketing then we will finally make some
2:40:45
sales and fulfill our orders and I'm very very excited to be doing it live
2:40:50
with you guys so you can see my real practical steps and then you'll be able to mimic my years and years of
2:40:56
experience in strategies onto your own stores onto your own businesses with your different ways with your different
2:41:02
styles your different ways of marketing and your related products that will make sales and profits for you as well so we
2:41:09
covered the autods marketplace which is my number one recommendation that will come with private suppliers branding
2:41:15
customization messaging suppliers and product sourcing which I haven't showed you yet I'm going to leave that for the
2:41:21
order section so take advantage of the autods marketplace you can even go with
2:41:26
a certain category over here so you can go for a specific Niche or you can even search for a specific product like if
2:41:33
you want to search for something for your pets you can just search for the word pets and you'll see all of the relevant products for that take
2:41:39
advantage of the autods marketplace this is your all-in-one tool for finding the best suppliers to work with especially
2:41:45
with a smart filter system as you can see right here so you can see what chips to and from a specific region under a
2:41:50
specific price range and of course filtering through private suppliers so again the autods marketplace has it all
2:41:56
and it's included inside your $1 autods subscription after that you've got the 30 plus other Drop Shipping suppliers
2:42:03
that autods supports and you can see all of that under autod s.com suppliers so you can just grab products from all of
2:42:10
these suppliers and easily import them onto your Shopify store all of which I will show you soon next you've got
2:42:16
AliExpress which is a retail supplier it's other drop shippers that were buying from who will drop ship from a
2:42:21
drop shipper to the End customer but you can take advantage of their Us warehouse which will ship quickly from into the US
2:42:27
using major shipping carriers which is great and I showed you how you can check out if your seller is actually a good
2:42:33
one one that you can rely on because AliExpress is a Marketplace that is full of sellers then you've got worldwide
2:42:39
Brands and the 3pl strategy those that I do not recommend especially when
2:42:44
starting off because you're looking to simplify things and not to do everything manually but if you're down for the
2:42:50
manual grind that is where you're are going to find those suppliers the only thing is that worldwide brands also
2:42:55
comes with a $197 fee so take that into consideration if you really want to do it manually and keep it budget friendly
2:43:03
then just search Google for suppliers and that's also going to be a pretty big process because you're going to have to
2:43:09
differentiate between articles about suppliers and websites from the suppliers themselves so you might want
2:43:14
to look for the wholesalers or the manufacturers and those that will want to work with drop shippers so we pretty
2:43:19
much did all of that hard work and we put all of that inside the autods marketplace those who are looking to
2:43:24
work with drop shippers and those with trending products to sell so under that $1 for 14 days I think that that is the
2:43:31
best option but all of the options are here you can choose what is the best for you and you will not need other tactics
2:43:37
other strategies to find other suppliers this is what's going to do the work for you so good luck searching building a
2:43:43
relationship and starting to work with your Drop Shipping suppliers make sure to work with multiple suppliers and not
2:43:48
put all your into one basket and I'll see you in the next section where we can finally start importing the products
2:43:54
that we found to our Shopify stores moving on to step number four it's time
2:43:59
to finally start importing our products to our store and to optimize our product pages to make sure that they look really
2:44:05
good and have all of the relevant information so when the customers land on our product page they will like what
2:44:11
they see they'll have all of the relevant information and they will add the product to their cart and initiate
2:44:16
the checkout process here's a quick little recap of of everything that we have done so far we know how to find
2:44:22
winning products to sell and how to validate that these products have the highest chances of winning on our stores
2:44:28
we signed up and registered for our Shopify store in Step number two and we also configured all of our initial Store
2:44:34
settings so that our stores will actually be ready to sell once we import our products which is what we're going
2:44:39
to do next and of course getting our products in front of the eyes of our customers which is the marketing section
2:44:45
which of course is also coming up after we registered our stores we moved over to Step number three where we learned
2:44:50
what to look for and how to select the best Drop Shipping suppliers to work with those that can go with us hand
2:44:56
inand for a long time moving forward and building a healthy relationship with our suppliers and now in Step number four
2:45:03
we're finally going to import those products to our stores and get them ready to sell so in order to do this
2:45:09
there are of course two ways of doing it and I'm going to show you both ways both manual and the automatic way and the
2:45:15
product that I'm going to add to my store right now are the two products that I found product research and of
2:45:20
course I will have to fill it in with other relevant products just so that we won't only have two products in our
2:45:25
stores but the important thing right now is to get those products on our stores so you may have remembered that I did
2:45:31
find them on the autods marketplace even though you can use any product research method that I have showed you this is
2:45:37
the easiest way for me to find products at the moment and as you know I did find them on the autods marketplace and from
2:45:43
there adding products to our stores is as easy as hovering over the import draft button right here so this cat
2:45:49
steam brush product which I have ordered and I'm waiting for the delivery it should be any day now and once I get it
2:45:55
of course I'll show it to you guys I'll shoot marketing videos on it and I'll try to get traffic and sales on my store
2:46:00
with it so you can see here that I have four different warehouses that I can import this product from so I would like
2:46:07
to use the US Warehouse because I am targeting the US audience on my store that's my main audience of course I did
2:46:13
allow international shipping so customers worldwide will be able to see and also check out with this product
2:46:18
product but my main target audience is the us so I would like to ship quickly from into the us as I've explained so
2:46:25
I'm just going to choose the Us warehouse and I'm going to click on import draft now if you've got multiple
2:46:30
stores connected to your autods account just make sure the right store is selected up here on the top left in my
2:46:35
case of course it's Prime jungle so that is correct and I'm going to go ahead and click on import draft now we can see
2:46:41
that it's being uploaded to my store and it says right here the draft upload process has finished so it only took a
2:46:47
couple of seconds and now if I go to the drafts section of my store I can see the
2:46:53
cat steam brush right here now before I move on to optimize the product and get it ready to sell I want to show you
2:46:59
other ways to import products to your stores because I did say that I'm going to show you multiple methods I'm not only going to show you one and you can
2:47:05
choose whatever works best for you so if you're not using autods or if you are getting products from A supplier that's
2:47:12
not inside the autods system or the autods marketplace so let's say for example from AliExpress the what you're
2:47:19
going to have to do is go to the product page and simply move all of the relevant information transfer the titles and the
2:47:25
description and all the images from the supplier's website to your Shopify store now this is the manual way to do it
2:47:32
there are more methods to import products to your stores and I will show you them right after this method but if you want to do it the manual way what
2:47:38
you need to do is simply go to the product page from your supplier's website so let's say in this case I'm
2:47:44
going with AliExpress and I want to import this portable door stopper that you've also seen when I was doing my
2:47:50
product research but let's say I'm not going to do it from the autods marketplace okay either the product isn't there or I don't have autods or
2:47:57
for whatever reason I want to do it manually so what I'm going to look for is the seller who sold the most units
2:48:03
and also has positive reviews so here for example this one sold 64 times and this is the product that I'm looking for
2:48:09
this one sold 39 times 32 times 79 times and of course I'm also going to look at the pricing point so usually AliExpress
2:48:17
will give you the biggest the best recommendations right from the start so I'm going to go with the first one right
2:48:23
here and I can see that he's got a whole bunch of different variations available as well and overall this one does look
2:48:30
good delivery is free and it ships from China we do not have the US shipping
2:48:35
option for this product let's go with the one who is in second place which is
2:48:40
this one right here 79 just to do a quick comparison before we choose which one to go with so this one cost $18 and
2:48:47
another $150 for sh shipping so it's already more expensive by about $2 $3
2:48:53
and this one only has three variations so I'm going to go with this seller right here that has more variations
2:48:58
available so I can offer more things to my audience even though I'm going to show you ways inside autods where you
2:49:04
can add multiple variations even from other Sellers and even from different regions all inside the same product page
2:49:10
which is which is a great advantage to have so I'm not going to go with the more expensive seller I'm going to go with this one so what you're going to do
2:49:16
in this case is go to your Shopify store your Shopify dashboard and here you're going to click on products and as you
2:49:23
see I don't have any products yet because the one that I added on autods the cat steam brush it is in the drafts
2:49:28
page this is where we prepare it for optimization before importing it to our stores and then it goes to our product
2:49:34
page so I'm going to try to keep everything separate and not to confuse you with the multiple methods that we
2:49:40
have so let's put autods on the side and move back to the manual method of uploading products now I do not
2:49:46
recommend this method because it is the most timec consuming and we won't really have any automation whatsoever because
2:49:52
if I just upload everything from here onto my Shopify store then I won't know
2:49:57
if the price here might change sometime or if suddenly the product goes out of stock or if any other changes occur I
2:50:03
will not know that because I do not have Automation and if I have 50 100 1,000 products in my store I'm going to have
2:50:09
to refresh my suppliers Pages 1,000 times a day just to make sure that there are no changes so of course that does
2:50:15
not make sense and it is not scalable but if you want for example to run a one product store because you're completely
2:50:22
sure that this product is going to make it and you're not wasting any of your time so this might be one reason why you might want to do it manually although it
2:50:28
is not my preferred method but anyway here we go so you're on the Shopify dashboard you clicked on products and
2:50:34
now you're going to click on ADD product now here you're going to move all of the information so what is the title the
2:50:39
description you're going to have to download all of the images from AliExpress and upload it right here so
2:50:44
we're going to start from the top we're going to copy the title and guys do not not copy titles and descriptions the way
2:50:50
I'm doing so now and that is simply because you do not want a badl looking product page with a super bad
2:50:57
description and that is what you're going to get if you're copying and pasting from your suppliers on top of
2:51:02
that you're going to have a copied and pasted page Google knows that and they're not going to make your product page rank anywhere near your supplier's
2:51:09
ranking because they know which page came first and which page has the original data so I copied the title in
2:51:15
the description and of course you can change that so if you're doing it manually you can simply go over to chat
2:51:21
GPT and you're going to create a new chat and you're going to say generate a
2:51:27
title and description for my eCommerce store for the following product okay
2:51:34
then we're going to make a line break we're going to give it the title and we're going to give it the
2:51:40
description as well okay this is the best way to do it
2:51:45
if you want to totally do it manually and write your own title in description that is also a way to do it but I'm
2:51:51
still trying to save you time even if you want to do things manually one by one Okay so we've already got the title
2:51:56
right here so let's compare that to the original title so this one is portable 2in1 alarm door stopper and suction cup
2:52:02
lock heavy duty self-defense travel security instead of portable alarm door
2:52:07
stopper suction cup door lock brace selfdefense door stop for ant you can already see the differences right there
2:52:14
that this title looks a little bit better it sounds better it's not just a whole bunch of words that don't even
2:52:21
sound right when you say it one after the other this one actually sounds a lot better so portable twoin one alarm door
2:52:26
stopper and suction cup lock right the words are connected you're kind of forming a sentence here and it just
2:52:32
makes much more sense to have the title like this and the description enhance your personal safety and protect your space with this portable twoin one alarm
2:52:38
door stopper and suction cup lock and in total you've got two short paragraphs and features with a bulleted list and a
2:52:46
nice little sentence to end it off stay secure and travel confidently with this versatile door stopper and lock system
2:52:51
so I think that is a great description and that is much better than features heavy duty these extra door locks are
2:52:57
constructed of robustly alloy aluminum it's not easy to break and deform the rubber suction cup will fasten to the
2:53:03
ground enough to stand strong to prevent force entry when it's on so here's the thing with this description you're
2:53:09
mainly talking about the features and what we want to do is we don't just want to sell features if I just try to tell
2:53:15
you guys hey guys buy this product because it has all of these great features you're going to be like okay
2:53:21
but you need to sell them why they need it you need to sell them the feeling that they will get once they actually
2:53:28
have possession of this product and this one does a little bit better enhance your personal safety and protect your
2:53:34
space so that does that right away it makes me think of oh wait my personal safety I do need to enhance that I do
2:53:41
want my space protected I feel like I want that that is something that I need instead of starting with heavy duty oh
2:53:47
it's heavy duty these these extra door locks are Constructor of robustly aloy oh that's exactly when I woke up this
2:53:52
morning I thought about how much I need a robustly alloy aluminum heavy duty
2:53:57
door alarm stopper in my house okay so this is why it's always better to generate it and to make it unique make
2:54:04
it your own and sell the feeling make sure that the customer understands why they need it and not just the features
2:54:09
the features can come later that's great after you already sold the product the feeling to the customer and the sense of
2:54:15
urgency of why they need it okay so this is the description that we're going with and as I scroll down now I've got the
2:54:22
media so these are the images and the hard part about AliExpress is even if I save this image right here it's going to
2:54:27
save it all in one image file you see all of these photos is going to be one
2:54:34
huge image and it's not going to make any sense to have that on our website so for that we are going to use a tool that
2:54:40
will let you download all of AliExpress's images and I will show you that tool later down in this video when
2:54:46
we get to the best Shopify apps section in this video but for now let's say I downloaded all the images one by one or
2:54:53
I used that tool to download all the images for me and I will upload them all right here but just for the sake of it
2:54:59
let me just do a quick screen grab and don't do it this way guys because it will not come out good I will of course
2:55:05
optimize this later but I just want to upload one image just so that you'll see what it will look like okay so we got
2:55:11
the image right here again really bad image this is not the one that I'm going to sell and here you're going to have to put the price so we are going to price
2:55:18
it at at least 2 and a half to three times the source price if we want to make a good return on our investment and
2:55:23
that is simply the way to do it so I'm going to go with $49.99 with this door stopper this is a
2:55:28
medium ticket product it's not easy to sell $50 products right from the bat right from the start because most
2:55:34
customers are not willing to put down large amounts of money on websites that they don't really know that is why we're
2:55:40
going to have to do a great job when it comes to marketing this product and we are going to have to get more creative with the more expensive products but
2:55:46
that is why I'm going with a cheap one which is that pet steam hair brush which is very very saturated on the market but
2:55:52
hey it's a cheap product and we're going to compare it with this alarm door stopper which isn't as saturated but it
2:55:58
is a medium ticket price and we're going to see which one here is going to win now again if we put more time down into
2:56:03
our product research way more than I put down in this video you're going to get much better product ideas but I'm here
2:56:09
to show you how to create a great store and how to have all of the tools and knowledge step by step and hopefully I
2:56:14
will also be able to drive some sales in even though I did not put the amount of time that I wanted into product research
2:56:20
but I know that you will do more either way we're going to have a nice little competition between these two products okay so I'm going to pric this one at
2:56:27
$49.99 and as I scroll down we've got the inventory right here so here you can say okay I'm selling this product from
2:56:34
the China Warehouse or from the US Warehouse or whatever warehouses we've created on our stores so here in this
2:56:39
case I've got a shop location which is my default Warehouse which is the Us warehouse and i' Al and I've also got the China Warehouse so I know that this
2:56:45
one only comes out of China therefore under China I'm going to write 10 units now if I sell 10 units I'm going to have
2:56:52
to come back and bring this back to stock because I'm doing everything manually or I can just uncheck track quantity and then it will always be in
2:56:59
stock but I will have to say which Warehouse it's being stocked in so I'm going to click here on edit locations
2:57:05
and I'm only going to keep it on the China warehouse and I'm going to click on done so a lot of manual work as you
2:57:11
can see right here and as I continue to scroll down so here under shipping we have to specify how much this weighs so
2:57:17
hopefully I can see what is the weight of this product but that is not always going to
2:57:23
be a given let's go to specifications nope we don't know okay so we're going to leave that blank in any case we're
2:57:29
covering shipping and here under variations we do want to add the extra variations so I'm going to click on ADD
2:57:35
options like size or color and I'm going to have to add the second variation so
2:57:40
this one is called standard now I don't know what the difference is yet this one is with an alarm and this one is without
2:57:47
an alarm it just stops the door from opening so we're going to call this standard no alarm so that is the extra
2:57:54
variation I'm going to click here on create now here I could add the value like again no alarm and we can see that
2:58:01
it was created down here and the price for that let's see it's a little bit cheaper since it doesn't have an alarm
2:58:06
so this one's going to go for $29.99 now again the only thing that I'm doing right now for pricing is I'm simply
2:58:12
adding 2.5 to three times the source price maybe a little bit more you can use a calculator if you want but right now I'm just doing things really quick
2:58:18
just to show you how it's done and anyway when I'm going to use autods everything we're going to calculate the break even and the profit percentages
2:58:24
and everything else and that is pretty much it when it comes to uploading a product of course I didn't do everything I didn't finish downloading and
2:58:30
uploading all the images and I also didn't add the rest of the variations but as I scroll down here to the end we
2:58:35
can kind of get a little look and feel of what this product will look like on the search engine so you're going to have the title right here and the
2:58:42
description here as The Meta description and the price of the unit now once we're done we're simply going to click on Save
2:58:47
and and this product was added to our stores but again there's no automation here and that is not my recommendation
2:58:53
but that is the manual way of doing it and if you want to work that way you're going to have to do it one by one every
2:58:59
product every image every description and use AI to generate better titles and
2:59:05
better descriptions either way it doesn't cost money just some extra time and it's definitely going to be worth
2:59:10
the effort so that is my recommendation if you want to go the manual way how to do it in the best way possible just make
2:59:16
sure that you have all of the important information inside including the sentences that help sell the product
2:59:22
that should be right from the start and AI will understand that and help you with that as well and have all of the
2:59:27
features have the dimensions if it has the weights specifications everything else further down the description and
2:59:33
just make sure at the end of the day that the product page is sellable and if you as a customer if you were to view
2:59:39
your product page would that do the job are you able to sell the product to yourself and if it does the work then
2:59:45
you know that you have a product page that is good enough to Market to your audience get them there and they will
2:59:50
purchase to check out if of course they are the relevant audience who are interested in your product and I'm going
2:59:56
to make sure that you are able to cover that in the best way possible when we reach the marketing section so I showed
3:00:02
you how to import the products directly from the autods marketplace which is the easiest way to do it you're simply
3:00:08
hovering over the product and you click on import draft and it's in your store within a couple of seconds the second
3:00:13
way or the manual way to do it is to Simply copy all of the information from your supplier's website and add it
3:00:19
directly to your Shopify store through shopify's dashboard under the products page but now let's go back to the
3:00:25
automatic methods which of course is the best way to move forward because we are here to save time we're here to scale
3:00:30
we're here to learn we're here to gather data and the best way to do that is to have as many things automated for us as
3:00:36
possible so that we can only focus on what is important so here we're going to go back to the autods Drop Shipping
3:00:41
product importer and this of course is included within your autods package So within that $1 trial you're going to
3:00:47
have access to the Marketplace to the product importer to price and stock monitoring and to many more of the automation features that I will show you
3:00:54
in this video as well as the manual methods if you want to go manual as well okay so the autods dropshipping Importer
3:01:01
has a few ways to import products into your store you can import single products I can import them one by one I
3:01:07
can import multiple items at once and I can also import products in bulk so I'm going to show you all of the ways to do
3:01:13
it starting with the first one the single product importer so now let's import the port portable alarm door
3:01:18
stopper onto our stores so I'm not going to do it manually I'm going to close down this products page I'm not going to
3:01:24
save these settings and we're going to do it again only this time it's not going to take us as long so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my
3:01:31
supplier's website okay let's say we're not doing it from within the autods marketplace or from the handpicked
3:01:36
products or the trending products or other methods that I showed you within the autods system to find products and easily import them to your stores here
3:01:43
we're going to go to one of autod DS's supported suppliers so all of the ones that I showed you from this page that
3:01:49
are retail and wholesale suppliers you can simply go to their websites grab products and import them to autods and
3:01:55
here is how that's done so you open up the product page of the product that you want to add in this case it's this portable alarm door stopper I'm going to
3:02:02
hover over the URL and copy it you can copy the whole URL or in this case just everything that's um under HTML doesn't
3:02:10
really matter so you're going to copy that you're going to move over to autods and you're going to hover over add products and here we're going to click
3:02:17
on single product now I'm going to paste the URL of that product and you can automatically see that it knows that
3:02:23
AliExpress is a supplier source and the region for this product is China if you need to change it simply click on it of
3:02:28
course very easy choose the right supplier and the right region now I've got two options I can either publish it
3:02:34
directly to my store or I can click on edit now quick now I always like to optimize my products and it's very
3:02:40
obvious as to why we need to do that so I'm going to click on edit now quick there are other selling channels where
3:02:45
it's easy to sell products directly at as is from the suppliers websites but even on those places I would rather
3:02:51
optimize my product pages but in Shopify it's super important to do so again in just a couple of seconds all of the
3:02:57
products information is being transferred from our supplier's website directly to our store directly to our
3:03:03
drafts page inside autods so the drafts again is not being published yet on our stores it's once we finished we move it
3:03:10
from drafts to products and then it will actually be live on our stores but before we do that we're going to optimize the product so let's do that
3:03:16
now so now that the product is in my draft page let's click on this Arrow right here to open up the editor and
3:03:22
start editing the product from the ground up and save a lot of time compared to doing everything manually as
3:03:28
we did just a few minutes ago so the first thing that we can optimize is of course the title then we've got the
3:03:33
collections the tags and everything else but right now let's focus on one of the most important parts the title and the
3:03:39
products description so we do have the default title and description from the supplier's website and as you can see
3:03:45
here you didn't have to download and upload all of the images and of course the titles and the descriptions
3:03:51
everything was done automatically for us but we're not going to keep it this way we're going to make our product pages look much better than this and here is
3:03:58
how we're going to do that so the first thing is that we're going to optimize the title in description with the help
3:04:03
of artificial intelligence so I'm going to click right here on optimize title with AI so yes we can do it from within
3:04:09
the system and I highly recommend to do that because it's simply much easier to have everything in one place and here's
3:04:15
how we're going to do it so once I clicked on that I got this little popup generate product title but I'm not only going to optimize the title or only the
3:04:22
description in this case I want both the title and description and as you see we have a few options for the tone of the title for the tone of the description
3:04:29
and for the overall temperature of the text so for the tone of the title you can make it some more professional more
3:04:34
funny more sellable or optimize it for social networks and for the tone of the description you can add a few more
3:04:40
options like optimize it for social networks detail description with comparison or description with usage
3:04:45
examples but in my case I'm just going to keep everything professional with a balanced temperature let's go ahead and
3:04:51
click on AI WR I can see that this will cost me 14 credits you can buy more AI
3:04:57
credit balance right here but you will get free credits when you create your autods account so you can start off by
3:05:02
using that and I'm going to click on AI write and in just a couple seconds I got everything done for me I did not have to
3:05:08
write any specific prompts to get it done so we've got portable alarm door stopper with suction cup travel security
3:05:14
device for enhanced door lock protection and self-defense against theft so again
3:05:20
not just a whole bunch of words that are crammed together but that don't make any sense when you say them out loud one after the other but you've actually got
3:05:27
a sellable title in a description here that's a little bit more difficult to read because of all of the HTML codes
3:05:33
that we've got here but of course we will not see them on the product page it will just make it so it will be align better and look better on the product
3:05:39
page so we can review that later let's go ahead and click on Save and we can see that it was updated so now I can see
3:05:45
that the title is the optimized title with the help of artificial intelligence and the description we've got it right
3:05:52
here so here is the title and now it's a sellable sentences so instead of saying that it's made of aluminum alloy and
3:05:59
heavy duty here's how it's starting off the portable alarm door stopper is an essential door security device designed
3:06:06
for individuals who prioritize safety whether at home or traveling so here right way you could think I am an
3:06:13
individual who prioritizes safety and let's continue to the second paragraph we do want to see that the paragraphs
3:06:19
are short don't make your customers read a whole book on the product page they'll get bored and they'll leave because the information is just too much and also
3:06:25
will probably not be as relevant equipped with a sensitive vibration sensor it emits an 80 DB alarm when it
3:06:32
detects any attempt to breach your security and then we've got the features all right so overall it looks good it
3:06:39
has all of the important information it has the features it has the feeling that you're trying to sell so we're going to
3:06:44
go ahead and click on Save now of course we will do further optim ization but I want you to get the main picture of how
3:06:50
easy it is to get all of this done automatically without putting too much work in and it's still going to be unique it's still going to be original
3:06:57
you're still going to have all of the important information inside more than ready to start selling okay so let's go
3:07:02
back to the product because we didn't finish everything under the product column so we've got the products title and we've got the collections so here
3:07:09
you can add it to a certain collection that you have we don't really have too many collections on our store cuz we just created it but right now let's just
3:07:15
put it on the homepage then we've we've got the tags so the tags is really going to help you further down the road
3:07:21
understand which tags perform the best which are the low performers and it'll simply make your job much easier to
3:07:27
analyze your product's performance through specific tags that you chose for example if you've got a certain season
3:07:32
coming up like let's say summertime you can give all of the summer products a summer tag and when summer is over you
3:07:39
can decide if you want to keep the summer tag products in your store or remove them or do whatever adjustments
3:07:44
are needed and same thing not just of course for seasons so you can see that it's pretty much automated and we've got
3:07:49
three tags that were pre-selected for us from autods we've got Home Improvement Hardware and door hardware now you can
3:07:56
of course add more and in this case I would add one that's called security okay and you've got right here alarm
3:08:01
systems and security so I'll probably choose that one as well so that if I import several alarm systems in security
3:08:08
I can easily pull up the tags later on under the products page which I will also show you in this video and it's
3:08:13
going to be a part of the filters that we can choose and see only those types of products all right next we've got
3:08:19
shipping methods so here you can choose which shipping method you want autods to
3:08:24
grab from the supplier so it will know how to price the product so what do I
3:08:29
mean by that if we have a few different shipping methods from AliExpress like if we click here on free shipping sometimes
3:08:34
we can see a few different shipping options let me see if I can show you an example of what that might look like so
3:08:40
let me just open a couple more products here that have several shipping options so this one right here so if if
3:08:47
I click on shipping I see that I have free shipping but I've also got another shipping option and it will make the
3:08:53
product maybe arrive sooner by by in this case just by one day which is obviously not worth it but this is just
3:09:00
a quick example so you have several shipping options and let's say that this $4.50 for shipping will arrive one week
3:09:06
sooner than the free shipping method so here the auto system is asking you okay you want to add this product to your
3:09:11
store so we know that it costs $51 but what about shipping do you want us to take the this shipping method or do you
3:09:18
want us to take this shipping method into account cuz we want to know how much the product will really cost you so that we'll be able to give you the
3:09:23
profitability that you're looking for so here's where the shipping methods come in so you've got the cheapest so you can say okay hey autods just give me the
3:09:31
cheapest shipping method I don't care if it has tracking or not then you've got cheapest with tracking so here you're
3:09:36
telling the system okay I want the cheapest shipping option available as long as it has tracking information
3:09:42
because some shipping methods on AliExpress or whatever supplier you're using might not have tracking information available so here you're
3:09:48
saying I want the cheapest one as long as it has tracking or you have the option fastest with tracking so here
3:09:54
you're telling the system give me the fastest shipping option as long as it has tracking and I would recommend
3:10:01
cheapest with tracking because we are looking for suppliers who ship quickly anyway and if you go with fastest with
3:10:08
tracking then the system in the example that we saw here we'll choose this one
3:10:13
and that'll cost us another $453 and it'll just save us a couple of days so that's not really worth it again
3:10:19
it depends on your suppliers but if you go with the ones that I recommend the cheapest with tracking is going to be your best option then we've got the
3:10:25
brand so you don't have to fill in the brand I even recommend not to fill in the brand and just leave it blank and
3:10:31
you've got monitoring so here you want to make sure that everything is on now in around the end of this video towards
3:10:36
the end I'm going to go over all of the autods settings so that you will be able to have the right default settings
3:10:42
inside autods so that way when you're importing a product to your store all of the settings that you want will be
3:10:47
preconfigured and you won't have to toggle everything and do all of the default things over and over again but
3:10:53
here under monitoring we do want everything to be on stock monitoring price monitoring and automatic orders so
3:10:59
now that everything looks good we're going to click on Save and we're going to move over to the next tab which is the description we already took care of
3:11:05
this one so now let's move over to the variations now here you can see that only one variation was imported out of
3:11:12
all of the variations that we have available and that is because in the autods default settings I need to Mark a
3:11:18
checkbox called upload variations and like I said I will go over the settings towards the end of this video so that
3:11:23
you will have everything and it will be the perfect closure to this video so that you will have everything you need
3:11:29
from this video but for now let's add the variations one by one because let's say we didn't pre-configure that we want
3:11:35
to upload variations or let's say we did have it on but we want to add more variations so whatever the reason all
3:11:41
you have to do is copy the URL of the variation that you want to add and simply add it as another variation now
3:11:47
now the thing is it doesn't even have to be from the same seller you can even go to a completely different supplier or a completely different seller and even
3:11:53
from other regions in this way you can add variations that no other drop shipper has out there and this is how
3:11:59
you're going to make your product page even more unique so let me take another variation that looks completely different let's say I I will add these
3:12:05
variations as well but let's take an example from another seller just to show
3:12:11
you the flexibility that you have here so here I'm using the same supplier which is Aliexpress but I'm using a
3:12:17
different seller you can even use a different supplier like I mentioned but let's say we want this variation right
3:12:22
here this is without the alarm this is with the alarm so this is just another design for the same product so let me
3:12:29
copy the URL right here and go back to the drafts page on autods and here under
3:12:34
the variations tab I'm going to click on ADD variant down here and I'm going to add the URL for the extra variation that
3:12:40
I want and I'm going to click on ADD variant and now the process has started okay now the second variation was added
3:12:46
so you can see that we we've got the second one that we found this one right here also a great product of course I
3:12:52
chose it because it does have a lot of sales it does have great reviews and it's a similar product with a different
3:12:57
design that other online Shoppers might prefer over the original one so I do want to have this one as another option
3:13:03
so that's how simple it is to get another variation from another seller on the same product page now you can also
3:13:09
edit each and every variation so you can do it in bulk just grab them all and
3:13:14
make any changes that you want by clicking on edit and then you can change the fees the quantity the profit percentage and whatever you want and you
3:13:21
can also do it one by one so you can see this edit button here on the right you can click on that or you can just click
3:13:27
on the image of the variation doesn't really matter and once you do that you get a popup screen with all of the variance information for example what
3:13:33
are the fees and how much profit you want to make and how much you want to sell it I'm not going to touch that right now but I will get to it soon then
3:13:40
you got the automation which is a nice little feature to make sure that your product is always making the most amount
3:13:46
of profit while still breaking in sales so I'm going to go over all of those things and to include the shipping price
3:13:51
which as I mentioned is important so if you're paying for shipping it's going to be added to the source price of the
3:13:57
product then we've also got round sents which is a great thing to have I usually like to round my sents to 97 it just
3:14:05
looks better and we've got the compare price so we're also going to add a Price Slasher to our variations so I'm going
3:14:11
to do all of the pricing soon I just want you guys to see where it's at then we've got the general which is the variations Nam so you can change the
3:14:18
name of the variation the quantity how much you want in stock so if for example you've got a quantity of 10 and you sell
3:14:25
two units then it's going to go from 10 to 8 and autod DS will bring it automatically from 8 back up to 10 the
3:14:31
units weight right here the dimensions you can see that everything was automated for us we didn't really have to touch anything so once you're good
3:14:38
with your variation you're just going to click on Save and that is how you can edit each and every variation so we went
3:14:43
over the product which is the title the collections the tags and all of that we went over the description both the
3:14:49
products title and description was both optimized using our internal AI tool the variations is where we were able to add
3:14:56
more variations remove variations edit variations and add more variations from other sellers even in other regions if
3:15:02
you want now we've got the images tab so this is where you can kind of mess around with the images and either choose
3:15:09
another image to be your main image or edit any image that you want we can see that this is our current main image so
3:15:15
if for example we wanted to switch it to another one like let's say we wanted this one to be our main image we would hover over that and click on set main
3:15:23
image now we've also got the edit button so here's where we have a nice little image editor where we can do a whole
3:15:28
bunch of things like crop flip rotate draw add shapes icons texts masks
3:15:34
filters and things like that so here for example I can add a text make it bold so that people can see it and I'm going to
3:15:41
write right here free shipping and we can just make the text a little bit bigger and drag it to wherever we want
3:15:47
and of course continue to do more and more things so this is just a quick example so I'm just going to click on
3:15:53
Save and we can now see that the main image has that text there and more things that we can do here for example
3:15:58
is adding more images so you can add a URL to another image and it will be added so you don't have to download and
3:16:04
upload or if you do want if you already have it downloaded or if you want to download the image before uploading just go ahead and click on this upload image
3:16:10
right here and then you can simply choose the file from your computer and it will upload as another image right
3:16:15
here in the gallery now we're remember we want our images to look great we want the image to be able to show the
3:16:21
customer to give them the feeling of why they need this product and try to get them to understand what it is by simply
3:16:27
looking at the main photo because this product right here it's not very easy to understand what it is and what it does
3:16:33
just by looking at the main image luckily the buyer didn't start by looking at the main image they probably
3:16:38
got to our product pages by seeing the videos that we made of the product which we marketed either organically or by
3:16:44
using paid marketing methods which I will show you soon in the video and after the images we've got item
3:16:49
specifications so here is extra information about these products and as you can see everything here was
3:16:54
automated we didn't have to copy and paste from our suppliers websites to our product pages you can see that
3:17:00
everything moved over so so for example the certifications the product type the occasion that you might want to use it
3:17:06
for some of its main features and so forth so here you can edit any one of them by clicking on this edit button
3:17:12
right here and you can change what you want the title or the description to be
3:17:17
you can remove any ones that you don't want you can add new ones by clicking on add item specification so for example
3:17:23
you can say color and add red and you can edit all item specifications if you want to edit all of them and so that
3:17:29
pretty much sums up all of the ways that you can optimize your product before having it go live on your store and
3:17:36
making sure that it has everything right before having it go live so I want to show you what it looks like once it's
3:17:41
actually live on your store but for that we're going to have to move it from the drafts page to the products page which means we are going to have to import it
3:17:48
but before that I want you to see the rest of the importing methods so that you will be able to choose the best
3:17:53
importing method when you want to grab products from your supplier websites and import them to your drop shipping stores
3:17:59
so we already talked about going over to the ad products and then adding a single product you're going to add the URL from
3:18:05
your supplier right here and this is what we just did in order to get these products here to the draft section of our stores where we can completely
3:18:12
optimize them before having them go live the other methods include again hovering
3:18:17
over add products only this time instead of single product we're going to go with multiple product/ stores and here you
3:18:23
can simply add the URL or URLs or even the product IDs of all the products that you want to add to your store so let's
3:18:29
say you want to add a few of these alarm products to your store let's say you want this one right here so you're going to open that up and go back let's say
3:18:36
you also want to add let's see something that looks different this four pack right here so let's say I've got a whole bunch of products open right here and of
3:18:43
course they can be from different websites so let's also open up for example Walmart and let's open up for
3:18:49
example Amazon and just open up a whole bunch of websites that autods supports
3:18:54
from autod s.com suppliers over 30 of them that you would like to sell so here for example I'm also going to write
3:19:01
alarm door stoer not sure if they have the same exact one or they have this one
3:19:06
but they don't have the red one which is great because that's the one that I ordered so let's say we also want to add
3:19:12
this one right here and also and also on Amazon I'll search for
3:19:17
alarm door stoppers and we do seem to have this one right here also and this one sells for $22.99 with a 20% coupon
3:19:25
so we could consider them to ship faster from into the US they also have a two
3:19:30
pack and a three pack so these are actually some pretty nice variations but they are not sold by Amazon Prime which
3:19:37
isn't as friendly this person is most likely Drop Shipping from AliExpress to
3:19:42
Amazon in any case let's just go back and choose other product that are like this so there aren't too many besides
3:19:49
those two variations let's say we also want to go for this pinkish one right here okay so now we have a whole bunch
3:19:54
of product like let's say we want to add this one and this one and this one and this one so how can we add all of them without using that single product
3:20:00
importer what we're going to do is again hover over add products click on multiple product/ stores and then here
3:20:06
inside this box you can enter the URLs of the products that you would like to add inside so I'm going to click on this
3:20:13
one I'm going to click on copy I'm going to go here and paste it right here then I'm going to make a line break and move
3:20:19
over to the next one copy the URL paste it here line break next one copy the URL
3:20:25
paste it right here and you're going to continue this process as you go down so you can add a bunch of products this is
3:20:30
the whole URL you can even add only the product ID so for example on Amazon the product ID is what we call the Asin so
3:20:37
you can grab it right here from the URL I just know what it looks like if you don't know you can just add the whole
3:20:42
URL and then just add the Ace in here or again add the whole UR URL so again here it is on Walmart another alarm door
3:20:50
stopper so here you can go on as long as you wish and add multiple products onto
3:20:55
your Drop Shipping Store the only thing is you want to add from the same supplier in every instance so in this
3:21:01
instance let's say I would only add the AliExpress one so let's say one AliExpress URL right here another one
3:21:07
here another one here another one here make sure that the supplier source and the region is correct and click on ADD
3:21:12
as a draft and then same thing for other suppliers that you want to work with so let's say w is another one so you're
3:21:17
going to add multiple products and paste it here and the next URL let's say it's this product here grab the URL paste it
3:21:25
right here and so forth so this is how you're going to use the multiple product importer once you're done you're going to click on ADD as a draft and all of
3:21:31
those products will get added to the draft section where you can optimize them before having them go live so that
3:21:36
is a second way to automatically add multiple products to your stores and save a lot of time the Third Way is once
3:21:42
again to hover over add products and under multiple products we're going to click on that again only instead of URLs
3:21:48
or IDs we're going to click on upload CSV and this is where we can add bulk products to our stores and this is once
3:21:55
you really want to fill up your stores with a whole bunch of products and test the market or simply add it from a niche
3:22:00
that's selling really well for you and that way you're just going to save an endless amount of time adding them one
3:22:06
by one even with automation so let's say for example that the security Niche is
3:22:12
going really well for you or actually you know what let's take it back to the pets Niche so let's say pet supplies
3:22:17
okay let's say that this is going really really well for your store and you just want to make a big pet Niche for your
3:22:23
store with a whole bunch of products you can of course narrow down by searching for exactly what type of pet supplies you want to add but let's say that we're
3:22:30
keeping it broad for now so I want to add all of these products to my stores how can I do that without having to open
3:22:36
up all of the tabs and copying all of the URLs and pasting them back into the ad product section on autods and so the
3:22:43
way to do that is by using the autods helper Chrome extension it's a free extension that you can use you got to
3:22:48
link to it inside the Shopify Drop Shipping cheat sheet it's called autods helper Chrome extension so you're going
3:22:54
to click on that and you're going to add this to your Chrome now once you have this added you're going to notice this little icon here DS and it's going to be
3:23:01
connected to your store now once that happens you can use the bulk Adder tool so search for the product that you want
3:23:07
and you'll notice that now there's this circle right here on the bottom right of my screen that is the same extension
3:23:13
that we can see here on the top right so this is the Chrome Helper extension and what we're going to do now is we're
3:23:18
going to add all of these products by clicking on this extension on the bottom right and then we're going to click on
3:23:24
extract and now all of the 57 products that we have on this page all of the product IDs got extracted into this
3:23:31
extension now you can move on to other Pages like let's go to page two and you can add all of the products on page two
3:23:37
as well just click on extract once you're standing on it and now we've got 11 products now what we're going to do
3:23:42
is simply export all of those products it's going to download a file onto our computer and we're going to upload that
3:23:48
file back onto autods so here's how that's done we're going to click on export as CSV and now you can see that a
3:23:54
CSV file was downloaded onto my computer now I'm going to head back to autods and
3:23:59
where it says drop CSV file I'm going to click on that or I can just drag and drop the file right there so I'm going
3:24:04
to look for that file here it is Aliexpress export. CSV I'm going to click on open it says processing CSV and
3:24:12
file has been uploaded so now make sure that your supplier source is correct in this case it was AliExpress and I'm
3:24:18
going to click on ADD as a draft now all of those 100 something products all of them are going to be added to the draft
3:24:23
section of my store within seconds all of the images and the descriptions and the titles and the specifications and
3:24:30
the variations everything is going to be added to the draft section of my store so again it just takes seconds and then
3:24:36
it just takes a few minutes to optimize all of our products make them look real good especially with the help of artificial intelligence and other tools
3:24:43
which I will show you further down this video so those are the the best ways to add Drop Shipping products to your
3:24:49
stores and save a whole bunch of time using either the single product importer the multiple or the CSV file uploader
3:24:56
whereas the multiple and the CSV uploads can get help from the autods Chrome extension to help you grab all those
3:25:02
products and easily add them to your stores and you've also got the manual method which as you guys know I truly do
3:25:08
not recommend but it's still an option that you can use now if you're asking yourself okay I want to add these
3:25:13
products to the draft section but I want to add them with a few different settings inside like I want the pricing
3:25:20
settings to already be configured or I want the variation settings to be configured in advance before I add them
3:25:26
to my store so I won't have to do it one by one after I add multiple products to my stores so there's a few ways to do
3:25:32
that one is if you go to the settings now I'm going to do the settings at the last part of this video so of course
3:25:38
make sure that you watch it till the end and don't do it all in one take it's a lot of information to process but if you
3:25:43
go to the settings you've got your list settings make sure that your store and your supplier are selected and here you
3:25:48
can say okay every time I list a product I want all of these things to happen so I'm going to go over that in the
3:25:54
settings part of the video but another way to do it is when you're actually adding products and now we'll go through
3:25:59
with the product import process so back on the draft section of my store what I'm going to do now is remove these two
3:26:05
products and I'm going to read them using the multiple product importer with the rules that I want so let's say I
3:26:11
didn't have it configured in the settings yet so what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove them but before that let me just copy the information cuz we
3:26:18
already do have a good title and a good description that we can use for these two products so this is the title for
3:26:23
the first one let me just save it really quick in the description okay second product is here
3:26:30
title
3:26:35
description okay so now we're going to do a bulk edit so I'm just going to grab these two products right here by
3:26:41
selecting this checkbox here it'll select everything that I have down here and I'm going to click on remove from
3:26:47
list you're about to delete your drafts are you sure I'm going to click on delete okay great I removed them now
3:26:52
let's add them this time not through the marketplace but rather through the supplier which in this case was
3:26:57
AliExpress so the first one was the portable alarm door
3:27:03
stopper and I'm going to click on the product right here and I'm going to copy the URL add products and autods multiple
3:27:11
products and we're going to paste it right here and the second product was a pet steam brush now if you're asking
3:27:18
yourself if it's so easy to find these products on AliExpress why won't the customers just go to AliExpress and buy
3:27:25
from there instead of purchasing from our websites that is a great question and the answer to that is all online
3:27:32
Shoppers will simply not do that so think about it this way when you're looking to buy something online and you
3:27:37
see a nice ad or a nice video for a product and then you go to the website and the website looks good what are the
3:27:42
chances that you're going to go to Amazon and AliExpress and all the other websites and even if you're saying the chances are pretty high that I'm going
3:27:48
to do it then you are the 1centers because 99% of the people are simply not going to do that that's just the way
3:27:54
that it works and if you've been Drop Shipping for a while now you know exactly what I mean so don't worry about it we talked about Market saturation and
3:28:01
I'm going to try to prove that and tackle that myth by trying to sell some of the most saturated products on the
3:28:07
market look at how many sellers are selling this pet steam hairbrush which I'm going to try to sell and make a
3:28:13
profit myself even though so so many Sellers and so many drop shippers are already selling this product now I'm not
3:28:20
saying go to the most saturated products in the world and try to sell them but I don't want you to get burned out when
3:28:25
you see one product is being sold a lot of times on the market and this is how you'll be able to narrow down to even
3:28:30
better products the more research that you do the more data will start coming in the more things you'll be able to
3:28:36
play around with and test and the more you'll learn how to find the more special products the ones that just came
3:28:41
out right now that are similar to those that are already selling for you your suppliers the relation ship that you
3:28:46
will be building with them will make it easier for them to also reach out to you and let you know when a new product line
3:28:52
is coming out that is very similar to something that you're already selling well they're going to try to help your business also because you're also
3:28:58
helping them but you got to start from somewhere so here I added the two URLs of the products that I want to add the
3:29:04
pet steam hairbrush and this alarm door stopper now before I go ahead and click on ADD as a draft I'm going to hover
3:29:11
over this Arrow right here and you see that it says create and publish so that means that I can just publish them
3:29:17
directly on my store without even adding them as a draft which I don't want to do because I do want to optimize these products you can schedule them to upload
3:29:24
at a later time and date or you can click on edit upload settings so this is if you want different upload settings
3:29:31
and you don't want to do it one by one after they're on the drafts page and you also didn't preconfig it in the settings
3:29:36
page as I just mentioned so we're going to do that here we're going to click on edit upload settings click on next and
3:29:41
now before they get added to the drafts the system is saying okay so you want to add two prod products they're from AliExpress China and first the general
3:29:49
settings so you can click on edit you can see what those general settings are so do you want to add TXS to these products Collections and you've got a
3:29:55
price range here so this is if you're adding a whole bunch of products but you don't want products that are priced between X and Y to upload to your store
3:30:02
so you can exclude them by adding their price ranges here and automation now I do want them to have automatic price
3:30:07
monitoring and stock monitoring and automatic order so I'm going to definitely have those on and we're going to click on update so those are the
3:30:14
general settings now we've got plier settings so I'm going to click on edit right here now here I don't want to
3:30:19
allow duplicates I can add categories to tags allow out of stock variations I will do that because when they come back
3:30:26
in stock then it will also go back in stock on my store as well upload variations which I definitely want to
3:30:31
have capitalized title doesn't really matter cuz I'm going to change the title anyway I don't want to apply a watermark
3:30:36
autofill the brand I'm going to leave autofill brand off and anyway I'm going to leave off the rest of the options I will walk you guys through them when I
3:30:42
do the settings part of the video as I mentioned next we've got price ing so here you can add automatic pricing so I
3:30:48
can say use each supplier's default settings or I can turn that off and set my own pricing settings so here we are
3:30:54
going to set our break even fees for this product again we can do it once it's in the draft section of our stores but I want you guys to see that you also
3:31:01
have the option to do it before adding it and this way the same rules will apply to all of the products that you are currently adding instead of doing it
3:31:07
one by one through the variations later so let's try to understand our break even when drop being on Shopify so in
3:31:14
order to do that we're inside the settings page page inside our Shopify dashboards and I'm going to click on
3:31:19
plan so you can see that I've got the basic plan as you guys know I registered for $39 a month and here I've got my
3:31:26
rate so if anyone is checking out on my website using Shopify payments which I signed up for so as you guys saw in the
3:31:31
video I sign up for Shopify payments so I do have that available right here 0% transaction fee which is great card rate
3:31:39
starting at around 2.9% plus 30 cents fixed fee and I've also signed up with
3:31:44
PayPal so you can see that that is active so I've got these two payments activated and this is the best way to
3:31:50
make sure that our customers have all of the checkout options and all of the payment settings that they need to check
3:31:56
out from my website and not have that as a blocker and not end up purchasing so we're looking at a VI of about 2.9% plus
3:32:03
30 cents fixed price if it's PayPal they usually take a few per more and we won't know if the customer is going to pay
3:32:09
with PayPal or Shopify payments in advance so we're going to take the higher fee into consideration which as
3:32:14
we can see from this chart right here you can see that PayPal checkout does take around 3.5% plus another fixed fee depending on
3:32:22
where the customer is from what currency they are using to purchase from our website so it is a little bit more
3:32:28
difficult to calculate our break even using the payments if we don't know what payments option our customers are going
3:32:33
to use plus there's another fee that we need to take into consideration when we are purchasing from our suppliers
3:32:39
website so whether it's AliExpress or any other supplier they could also charge us with tax on top of the price
3:32:45
that we're seeing here so that can usually be another 10% on the source price so because there's a few different
3:32:51
fees in play here you can decide on an average fee an average Break Even of
3:32:56
let's say around 8% which is your break even fee and on top of that you want to make another let's say 30% fixed price
3:33:03
because you're paying that fee as well and on top of that what is the actual profit margin that you want to make so
3:33:08
you can say Okay I want 50% profit margin and when it comes to drop shipping I would not recommend going
3:33:14
anywhere below 50 % because we are here to make a profit and we do not have to try to kill the market in order to gain
3:33:20
sales the price is a factor but not as much is the way that you are marketing this product to your customers because
3:33:27
in our case we are looking for special products where it's hard to guess the price because we don't see these products every day now in any case we
3:33:34
are going to mark up the product prices around 2.5 at least three times higher than the source price so that is also
3:33:40
going to help us understand what our selling price needs to be but then later on when it comes to understanding
3:33:45
exactly how much we profited we have to take everything into consideration the fees that we paid Shopify or PayPal the
3:33:51
payment provider the ads if we did run paid marketing ads like paperclick ads which I will run in this video and I'll
3:33:57
show you step by step also how to do it but not before we do it with Organic marketing that is absolutely free and we
3:34:03
can learn what videos are resonating with our audiences and then double down our budgets on them in paid marketing so
3:34:09
again all of the stuff really exciting further down this video but again when it comes to pricing I would say say that
3:34:16
this is the base that you want to start from okay so I'm going to update all of that and the last one here is shipping
3:34:21
so what shipping policies do you want to choose here and if we go with use each supplier's default settings it's the
3:34:27
settings that we're seeing right here under settings SL supplier settings you click on the supplier and you do make
3:34:33
the default settings right here so when it comes to the Lister you got the shipping methods right here which is cheapest with tracking in any case like
3:34:39
I said we're going to go through all of the settings but that is where that settings option is you can unclick that
3:34:45
and choose what you want it to be in any case we've got it on cheapest with tracking which is the right decision and
3:34:50
that is how you can set the settings before adding the products which is really good in the scenario where you do
3:34:56
want to change the settings and you're adding a whole bunch of products so during those few seconds we can see that everything was added once again so the
3:35:03
last thing that I want to do now is actually cherry-pick my variations and I don't just want to use all of the
3:35:09
variations that we have here because I really don't think that we need so many variations especially when it's the same
3:35:15
product only some are with the alarm and some are without the alarm and I don't think we're going to sell the ones with
3:35:20
uh these weird looking suction cups we just want the main one and maybe some other ones that can be similar to them
3:35:27
so that's how I'm going to finalize the product import process you guys now have the full arsenal of the best ways to
3:35:33
import your products and now I'm going to do it the way that I want so I'm going to delete these drafts and now we
3:35:40
are going to go with the main variation which is this one for the alarm door stopper so I'm going to go with multiple
3:35:47
products and I'm going to add the two products so one is the alarm door stopper and the second is of course the
3:35:55
cat dog steam hairbrush only I found this listing with all of these
3:36:01
variations and this is a listing with very relevant variations that I would
3:36:07
like to sell from the same seller so in this case I'm going to upload all of the same variations from the same seller you
3:36:13
can see that it's got over 5,000 units so great reviews lots of reviews they're all really good really high and it's
3:36:21
very cheap $33.33 add another $2 for shipping cuz we're not going to make it to $10 unless
3:36:26
of course our customers purchase multiple products under the same cart so I'm going to add all the variations that
3:36:32
we have from here but in the portable door alarm I'm only going to upload this variation plus the extra variation that
3:36:38
we got from the other seller as I showed previously so the way that we're going to do that is here we don't want to grab
3:36:44
the variation and here we do want to grab the variations so I'll do it one by one the first one that I'm going to add
3:36:51
is the alarm door stopper which is this one and I will go to edit upload settings and here under supplier
3:36:58
settings I do not want to upload the variation so it's going to only be a standalone product and that's it I'm
3:37:04
going to add that as a draft in a couple of seconds we're going to see it right here with only one variation so you see
3:37:10
right here it says variance one and we've only got that one variation so that's great now let's add the pet brush
3:37:18
and here we do want all the variations so I'm just going to copy the URL go back add products doesn't really
3:37:24
matter if I go single or multiple in this case I'm just going to go multiple it's pretty much all the same and here
3:37:30
in the upload settings it on the default setting because we didn't really change it we are going to upload variation so
3:37:36
I'm just going to show it to you guys it is uploading variation so that is fine I'm going to add as a draft and in two
3:37:42
more seconds it's going to be right here so as I speak it's adding the second product and as we can see we've got 13
3:37:48
variations right here and there was no Cuts here this is how long it takes to upload products to your store just take
3:37:54
a look at all of these lovely variations that we got now coffee handle green banana white handle yellow mango Green
3:38:00
Mango purple well so really really nice variation colors and it's too bad I
3:38:05
didn't order more I should have ordered much much more which by the way guys look what arrived in the mail so of
3:38:11
course I'm going to leave this when it comes to the in section of our store but
3:38:17
I did already get these two variations so we've got the orange one and I think
3:38:23
the other one is green I don't remember so we'll see it so here you've got the front view and here you can see the side
3:38:29
view as well so um yeah this is the product that I'm going to shoot marketing uh ads on this plus the other
3:38:36
variation plus the alarm door stopper which already arrived as well as you can see right here yeah well you can't
3:38:44
really see the product it's just the the box you can kind of see the product there behind the sticker uh everything
3:38:49
is in Chinese so we can't really understand anything but we get the points and I'm ready I'm ready to start
3:38:55
marketing let's get to that part and for the portable door alarm stopper let's look for the other variation that we
3:39:01
wanted to add because we don't want a whole bunch of variations that will probably end up not selling and it's going to be hard to distinguish between
3:39:07
all of these different ones so let's close down this one and the second one that we were looking for if I'm not
3:39:14
mistaken was this one with the alarm there we go so let's look at the
3:39:20
differences so it's pretty much just designed in a different way but it also looks like a great option to have so
3:39:27
let's also add this one as well so of course I'm going to go to variance I'm going to click on ADD variant I'm going
3:39:33
to add that other variation and click on ADD variant and let's see if there's anything that we're missing before we
3:39:39
move on maybe we should go for this third piece of door alarm which just goes under the door door doesn't look
3:39:46
like it's selling much let's see this just goes under the door and if it moves
3:39:51
it kind of triggers the button and then it makes the alarm go off so yeah I'm only going to keep those two variations
3:39:56
so they can kind of choose which design they want I guess I'll just call it design one and design two uh but we can
3:40:01
also add these other ones as uh not as accessories but like as frequently
3:40:07
bought together or something like that so we do have more alarm door stoppers that we are going to upload but we're
3:40:12
going to do that after we optimize these two products after we create our homepage and right before we're going to
3:40:18
start to Market our products once we have a nice look for our store we see what it's going to look like we see the
3:40:23
two main products that we're going to sell then we're going to add a whole bunch of other related products just to kind of fill up the store with more
3:40:30
products but right now I only want us to focus on what's important the products that we're actually trying to sell all
3:40:36
right so in the meantime let's copy and paste the titles and descriptions that we already generated for those products
3:40:41
okay so I saved it right over here so this is the cat steam brush we may optimize it a little bit more before we
3:40:48
start the marketing section so we're going to move over the title and description and we're going to do the
3:40:54
same for the portable door alarm so I'm going to go to that variation so you can see how fast we can edit all of our
3:41:02
products even while they're under the drafts page every little change I like to click on Save and of course we're not
3:41:08
doing save and import just a regular save for now edit the products description we
3:41:13
don't need all the images we can always add them later but right now we just need the good text with the right
3:41:19
variations and by the way you can always reoptimize your titles and description so whether you use the internal AI tool
3:41:26
or you maybe you wanted to make it more funny you can always go back and optimize a text so optimize title with AI and you can say to do it different
3:41:33
like hey you know what make it sound a little bit more funny or more sellable or you can go to chat GPT as well and
3:41:39
use the one that you already got from the internal tool to make that even better so for example you can write re
3:41:45
rewrite this product description to make it more engaging with bullet points and
3:41:53
emojis then we're going to paste the description and click on send and now it's going to rewrite that description
3:41:59
for the portable dorm alarm stopper and you can see that it's a little bit more colorful now it's got some nice emojis
3:42:05
the sentences are great they also capture on to the customer's emotion to the feeling so again really really good
3:42:13
descriptions and I'm going to to paste that over here and now it just looks better so we got a quick sentence stay
3:42:19
safe wherever you go with your portable door alarm stopper you got the emojis that are relevant to the product and
3:42:25
after every bullet point in the features you also have some nice emojis that portray the previous sentence helps you
3:42:30
connect to it even more protect yourself effortlessly with this compact reliable and easy to use security tool perfect
3:42:36
for keeping Intruders at Bay and boosting your confidence on the go great we're going to save that okay so we've
3:42:42
got the two variations that we want and I will edit the variations this time I already taught how to do it so this time
3:42:47
I'm just going to go ahead and edit it really quick okay so I'm just going to call this one design one and in the
3:42:52
price like we said 2 and 1 half to three times the source price so we're looking at $44.99 okay don't think too much about
3:42:59
it just price it around that level and don't worry about the rest we are going to calculate our actual profits first we
3:43:05
got to get out there start testing and start making this thing work so as you can see right here I did a round sense
3:43:12
to 97 I already explained about that and I am going going to give it a 40%
3:43:17
compare slasher this 4497 is going to be up 40% and then slash down to
3:43:22
4497 it works nice that way it's a nice little psychological effect and everything else is good so we're going
3:43:28
to save that we're going to move over to the second variation and we're going to call this one design two and this one is
3:43:34
also going to be repriced around the same so we're going to give it maybe even a dollar list just to kind of see
3:43:40
if that could make any difference I doubt that it will but it's nicer to have a price range rather than the same
3:43:46
fixed price even if it's $1 and same thing here we're going to round sents to 097 and give it a 40% SL price down to
3:43:55
4397 so we're going to save that okay so very quick variation changes and here on
3:44:01
the second product we're going to have to do it to all of the variations because we didn't pre-configure the
3:44:06
pricing so in this case while we do have a nice little price range between 367
3:44:11
and it can go up all the way until around $5 at the most add another $2 for
3:44:18
shipping if it's under $10 so around seven almost $7 at most so 2 and a half
3:44:24
times that price is around $6.99 I would say so that is how much we
3:44:29
are going to price it so what I'm going to do is I'm going to select all variants by clicking right here then we're going to click on this edit button
3:44:35
right here and then under sell price I'm going to go with $699 now I can always play around with
3:44:41
this I really think that this is on the low side but it is a cheap product it shouldn't cost too much and what I am
3:44:46
going to do is if I see that I'm making a lot of sales I will up the price and I'm going to show you how to do that on
3:44:52
autods as well so if you're using autods you can have the price automatically raised for you when you're making sales
3:44:58
and lowered if you're not making sales all up and down to a certain limit so that you will always stay protected and
3:45:04
that's a good thing to have if you really understand what is a sweet spot where you are making constant sales with the most amount of profit so right now
3:45:11
we're just going to go with the $6.99 price range it's going to leave us enough profit if we're making sales and we're doing the same for all of these
3:45:18
variations now of course you could go in one by one and change the prices okay if this is going to cost me a dollar less
3:45:24
then I'm going to price it a dollar less as well you can do that and then you'll also have a price range on your product
3:45:30
so it's going to look like okay this one costs anywhere between $14.99 to $6.99
3:45:36
okay but in this example I'm just going to stay on $6.99 and that's pretty much it our images mainly look good we can of course
3:45:43
remove the ones that don't look as good which is an important thing to do um here I don't notice anything bad I don't
3:45:49
really like all the text on images but again in this case it's not doing us any
3:45:55
harm if I notice anything repetitive or anything not good I can always remove it and item specifications are mainly fine
3:46:01
as well again we are going to see what it looks like on the product page and then we can decide more on what things
3:46:07
we think should be added now because I don't have this on my default settings I will have to turn on of course price and
3:46:13
stock monitoring and I'm going to going to click on save so that is on the product
3:46:18
section and later in this video when I show you how to do the settings we're going to do all these things on default so that we won't always have to do it
3:46:24
every time okay so everything looks pretty good pretty optimized we've got the titles descriptions the variations
3:46:31
images mainly look good let me see if there's anything here that we should remove okay so I'm not going to sell the ordinary style I remove that variation
3:46:38
so I am going to delete this image but before I do that I need to use another main image cuz right now the ordinary
3:46:44
style is is the main image for this one so I am going to change it and as you can see here in AliExpress I don't
3:46:50
really like the images that they are using so I will have to use an image probably from another supplier maybe one
3:46:57
like this one if it wouldn't have that play button but you have to make sure that it is the same product before doing
3:47:03
something like that exactly exactly the same here I would want to use this image right here let's just make sure that it
3:47:09
is exactly the same as the one that we're uploading which is this one and it is is
3:47:15
the same exact one same exact design no difference whatsoever okay so we're
3:47:20
going to go with this image since it's the better one so in order to download the images on your AliExpress listings
3:47:25
there's an extension called Ali saave it's inside the Shopify Drop Shipping cheat sheet again # Shopify with what
3:47:33
you learned in this video what is your top takeaway leave that in the comments below and I will send you access to that cheat sheet with everything inside until
3:47:40
then here we're going to click on add to Chrome on this extension called Ali saave Plus and what's installed go ahead
3:47:47
and refresh that page and here you can see these options that you can download the images and the videos so I'm going
3:47:53
to go with the six main images and now the extension is going to download these images onto my computer of course I
3:47:59
cannot save them one by one it's going to save them in different file formats which I cannot use and it will also
3:48:05
download the images as one big image that I will not be able to use so I
3:48:10
don't want one big image that's going to have all of this big mess okay so we're already done with the images now we're
3:48:15
going to go to autods and again under images we're going to click on ADD image and here we're going to click on upload
3:48:21
image and go to that directory where it downloaded everything so it's called Alli save plus with today's date so
3:48:27
we're going to click on that and then main images and you can see the six images that it downloaded but again I do
3:48:33
not need all of them I only need the one with the alarm icon and the cleaner one
3:48:40
so we're going to upload that one okay so you can see that it loaded up right here and the other one is as
3:48:47
well cuz I'm not sure which one I'm going to use as the main image yet but I would like to have both of them so again
3:48:52
just make sure that it's the same exact product if you're taking it from another supplier uh so again I think I am going
3:48:59
to go with this one it's a little bit more zoomed in it does have the alarm picture so you do understand better that
3:49:06
it comes with the alarm even though this one also has it and you do have that little red light that shows you that the
3:49:11
alarm is working so again I'm still not sure which one is going to work I might have to AB test them have this one on
3:49:17
for some days and then have this one on for some days for now I'm just going to go with this one as the main image and I'm going to go ahead and click on Save
3:49:24
now I will remove the images that say without alarm because I'm not using that variation so I'm going to just hover
3:49:30
over it and click on remove okay so again we've got alarm style ordinary style without the alarm we're not going to need it so I'm going to remove it and
3:49:36
make sure that you're going through the rest of your images so everything is fine everything is showing the one with
3:49:41
the alarm the text is okay I don't really like like it but it's not bad and
3:49:47
that's good enough so we're going to click on Save and let's choose a main image for the cat brush so there's a lot
3:49:54
of options here and we might go with the one that's already there which in this
3:50:00
case is this one you see some of the pets down here uh the background is a little bit white and boring but the rest
3:50:06
of them are not good enough to be main images okay so we are going to keep it on that one but I am going to take my
3:50:13
own images because I already ordered the product so I could change both of them or at least maybe just this one with my
3:50:19
cats and that way it'll be more unique and with a much higher chance to sell because if the person is trying to snipe
3:50:26
and understand where I got this product from which again is the 1centers but even those 1centers will not be able to
3:50:31
find the product so quick if I'm going to use my own original photos okay so overall we're looking good we're ready
3:50:37
to import these products to our stores so here I'm going to click on Save and import here I'm going to click on import
3:50:43
because it's already saved in any case you can see that both of these products right now are making their way from the
3:50:49
draft section to the product section of my store so now they're both going to be live and we will be able to start
3:50:54
selling them of course we have a few more things that we need to do until then but we are moving forward so I'm
3:51:00
going to click on products you can click here to see the status of each one so you can see that the petcom right now is
3:51:05
in progress one is already finished so that is the door alarm stopper so this one is completed and you can see it
3:51:12
right here on the products page and the pet coms as well okay so we can see that we've got 13 variations right here in
3:51:18
stock and two variations right here in stock and now we can see these two products so let's go over the product
3:51:24
page really quick so what we see here is the products themselves when it was uploaded today as we speak is September
3:51:29
29th 20124 and you can add an internal note so this is the only a note that you will be able to see if you need to write
3:51:36
anything and you've got more options here you can edit the product you can also edit by clicking on the image right here it'll open it in a new window and
3:51:43
here you can do the product optimization same way that we just did it from the drafts page and you can see how many
3:51:49
times the unit sold how many days it went on without selling what collection it's on if any and the variations so
3:51:56
what are available what are on hold which means it's in stock on the suppliers website but it's out of stock
3:52:01
on your website because there is some settings that you have configured that is bringing it out of stock I will go
3:52:08
over these things soon as well out of stock means it's out of stock on the supplier site so it also went out of stock on your site as long as a of
3:52:14
course you've got price and stock monitoring enabled total is how many total variations you have in each one
3:52:19
the price so this is the total price for the units so as we can see right here the buying prices for the pet brush
3:52:26
ranges between $4 to $516 and we're going to sell them for $699 the average
3:52:31
profit here is going to be between $ 11 to $12 that could be a little on the high side just for starting off we are
3:52:37
going to bring that down a bit but that's why it is good to see it from here as well and you've got the buy and sell ID so if I click on the buy ID ID
3:52:44
it'll take me to the supplier's website for this product and if I click on the sell ID I will see it on my website so I
3:52:51
can click on that and see what the product will look like on my store however my store is password protected
3:52:56
at the moment so you can see right here that you can only enter using password because we didn't go live yet so let's
3:53:02
go ahead and do that now under Shopify we're going to click on online store and here under themes you can see that your
3:53:07
online store is password protected so what we're going to do is click on manage password give yourself a password
3:53:13
that only you will have access to in my case 1 2 3 4 5 6 here come all the hackers to my store and now I'm just
3:53:20
going to enter using password when I try to preview the store I'm going to write 1 2 3 4 5
3:53:25
6 and now I can see these two products okay so what we did was we clicked on
3:53:31
this product right so let's click on it again and here's how the product looks on our store really easily imported
3:53:38
easily optimized with the help of AI product title description and all of the variations as we can see right here so
3:53:45
everything looks pretty clean we can see the description right here really nicely written with the Emojis and everything
3:53:50
that's on point not too long not too short it's got all the right stuff and I will continue to optimize it this is not
3:53:56
the final version but this is good enough to get started with so that we can move forward to the next steps but
3:54:03
some things that I do want to point out here are as follows so one you can see that one variation is out of stock
3:54:08
that's the beige avocado it just stepped out of stock in the last few minutes as we speak so we can see right here that
3:54:14
it's out of stock on autods it means that it's out of stock on the supplier's website and so it brought it out of
3:54:20
stock in our store as well so it's nice to see that live example but let's say that we want to change the variation
3:54:26
that we're seeing the first variation as soon as we land on this product page because again if I refresh it actually
3:54:32
it's going to refresh on that product ID so from autods you saw that I clicked on it from the products page let's say
3:54:38
you're inside the editor page on autods you can also click right here on view on Shopify and that'll take you to the same
3:54:44
link so let's say you don't want this as the first variation for the customer to see so what you're going to do is choose
3:54:52
what variant you do want them to see first so let's say we're going to go with this one right the coffee handle so I'm going to take that variation so on
3:54:59
Shopify I'm going to go to my products page and I'm going to choose this product I'm going to open up the editor
3:55:05
and here I'm just going to take that coffee handle one and I'll make sure that that is the first variation so I'm
3:55:10
just going to click up here and here first of all instead of calling it color let's call it design and I'm going to go
3:55:16
to that coffee handle and I'm going to drag it up to first place then I'll click on done and then I'll click on
3:55:21
save so some things we are going to do through autods because it's really easy to grab all these variations and all of
3:55:28
the text and the titles and the descriptions and all the images and all the pricing and everything to be completely automated for us and some
3:55:35
things we will have to do on Shopify like changing the variations order so now that that is done we're going to preview the product page again so we're
3:55:42
going to click here on view on Shopify and now I'm seeing the coffee handle as the first variation so that is
3:55:49
great the rest of the images look good and our product page is almost ready to
3:55:54
go we still have a few more tweaks a few more enhancements to do but now we're not seeing the first variant as out of
3:56:00
stock we can of course move the beige one somewhere further down below but overall we're not seeing the first variant out of stock everything here
3:56:06
looks in place and everything looks good let's check out the other product as well so the portable door alarm stomper
3:56:13
let's click on the Shopify link from autods and we can see it right here so portable alarm door stopper this is the
3:56:20
title that we made in the nice description and the images I'm not sure I like the order of the images uh too
3:56:26
much text being shown here as well so I will optimize that plus the main image
3:56:32
let's go and check that out so let's go back to the products page on autods click on that product to edit it and we
3:56:39
do have this as the main image but that variation is not selected first and that is because we did select a different
3:56:45
featured image here on autods but because we have multiple variations here it doesn't only look at one product it
3:56:51
actually looks at every variation so if I click here on variants you can see the main image for each variant and we can
3:56:56
change that right here so I'm going to click on edit and here I'm going to edit the image I'm going to click on change
3:57:02
image and I'm going to choose the right image for this variation so in this case we're looking at model 2 and model one
3:57:09
I'm going to change the names around because model two needs to be one and vice versa so this will be model two and
3:57:15
this will be model one so let's change the images as well so this is model one and also I can see that compare price
3:57:22
was not activated okay so let's change the image right here so we're also going to change image this is model one which
3:57:29
is this one right here so we said that we wanted to go with this one as the main image even though this one again it's looking pretty good but let's start
3:57:35
with this one okay model one and model two let's change the featured image over here so change image inside the
3:57:42
variation and we're going to upload image this time I downloaded the images for that one and we are going to choose
3:57:50
this one and we're going to save it and we are good to go so let's check out the
3:57:56
two products that we have and here we have the portable alarm door stopper so I just did two quick things I updated
3:58:02
the title I made it much much shorter portable alarm door stopper your travel friendly security solution I'm still
3:58:08
going to brainstorm something to not make it so easy to find this product so I'm going to think of something else to
3:58:13
call it and I'll keep you guys updated on that but for now I just want to have everything in place so that we can move on uh we have the description as we saw
3:58:20
nicely written with the help of AI and the images over here the other thing that I did is I did remove the other
3:58:26
variation from this product I only want to sell the alarm door stopper I don't want all of the variations and I don't
3:58:32
even want that second variation so I already have one product with lots of variations which is the pet brush which
3:58:38
is also much cheaper than this product and then we got this product a little bit more expensive only one variation so it's really easy to understand what you
3:58:45
are going to get and that's it we're going to get creative we're going to keep changing our ways we're going to
3:58:50
keep updating and trying new methods as we go along and I've been doing this for eight years I love testing new strategies I love changing my creatives
3:58:57
around I love testing new things and that is what I'm going to do here so everything looks good everything is in
3:59:02
place now if you notice that the products that you're adding are out of stock even though in autods it shows
3:59:09
that it's in stock so let me show you an example right here on the products page you can see that the variations are in
3:59:14
stock and on Shopify as well if you go to the product section you can see that
3:59:20
the variations are in stock and that the status is active but in some cases you
3:59:25
may see and this also happen to me that this product page that you have is out of stock even though it's in stock in
3:59:31
those two places that I showed you and if that happens the solution to that is inside your shipping profiles so if we
3:59:38
go back to the settings page on Shopify and we click on shipping and delivery
3:59:44
here is where we have the shipping zones and if you're creating multiple warehouses then you will have to assign
3:59:50
each product to its Warehouse so you're going to have to click on that warehouse for example you're going to click on Us warehouse or China warehouse and you're
3:59:58
going to assign the products to that warehouse now if you're only going to ship from one warehouse for example
4:00:03
let's say only from China then in this case you can just have a general shipping rate right here click on
4:00:09
General and under fulfillment location you can just use the default one that autods created when you connected autods
4:00:17
to Shopify so in this case the Fulfillment location can be autods and you will add a shipping rate as I showed
4:00:23
you provide free shipping and list all of the countries that you ship to so in this case the Fulfillment location let's
4:00:30
say is autods because we're only going to Source from China so here the shipping Zone we are going to add all of
4:00:36
the countries excluding the ones we don't want to ship to but in this case everything that chips from China can
4:00:42
pretty much go worldwide and we're not going to Target countries that we won't want to sell to anyway so they're not going to find their way to our stores so
4:00:49
in this case I chose all of the locations means that I can ship from China to anywhere around the world and I
4:00:55
added my free worldwide shipping rate so this means that everybody's paying nothing and I saved my settings and now
4:01:01
you can see that every product that we add newly created products are automatically added to this profile so
4:01:06
you add a product to autods it will automatically select the autods Fulfillment location which is our China
4:01:13
Warehouse that can ship anywhere to worldwide and of course you can change a China Warehouse to us or to anywhere
4:01:18
else however if you are shipping from multiple locations then you will have to add multiple warehouses under custom
4:01:25
shipping rates and you got to make sure that you have products that are connected to these warehouses otherwise
4:01:32
Shopify won't know what Warehouse it's connected to and what the shipment settings are and if you don't have and
4:01:37
if you're missing something like a shipping rate then it's going to show that the product is out of stock even though it is in stock so make sure that
4:01:44
your shipping rates are correct if you're shipping from multiple locations add multiple locations and add each
4:01:49
product to its proper location and if you're only shipping from one location then just edit the autods Fulfillment
4:01:55
location under the general settings under the general shipping rates and this will make sure that every product
4:02:00
that you add through autods will automatically get this shipping profile and it won't show itself as out of stock
4:02:06
so always make sure that you're checking your products and so that is pretty much it if we click on products on Shopify we
4:02:12
can see that the products are here they're in stock and they are fully optimized and we are going to do more
4:02:17
things to optimize them further down this video but again I just wanted to make sure that we get the products imported on our stores that they're all
4:02:23
showing us in stock that we played around with the variations that we optimize the titles and descriptions and the pricing and everything else and so
4:02:30
now that we are done with our product research registering our store getting our free do store domain name finding
4:02:36
our Drop Shipping supplier importing our products now it's time to move over to the next step website design and
4:02:42
branding you're going to learn how to design and brand your own store even if you have no skills and you've never done
4:02:47
it before and of course you want to keep it budget friendly after we are done with website design and branding we're
4:02:53
going to move over to Page's blog and navigation menu then we're going to install some really good Shopify apps
4:02:59
make sure that everything looks good our homepage our product page all of our legal Pages our blog our navigation menu
4:03:06
then we will finally get to the marketing part and start marketing our products shooting them out there to our
4:03:12
audiences and wait waiting for those sales and profits to come in I hope you're excited as I am good luck with
4:03:18
importing your products and I'll see you in the next step let's do a quick recap we finished product research we created
4:03:24
our Shopify store we imported our products after finding suppliers to work with and we imported those products to
4:03:30
our stores with the help of automation artificial intelligence and more and so the next step is to work on website
4:03:36
design and branding and that is exactly what we are going to do right now so let's go ahead and jump right in so on
4:03:43
step number five as you can see right here on the cheat sheet we've got website design and branding and we are
4:03:48
going to do a few things including editing our announcement bar working on the header creating a store logo and a
4:03:55
store banner and I'm going to walk you through both free and paid methods so of course you can choose whatever is best
4:04:00
for your business and the free method that I'm about to show you is more than enough okay so starting off with the
4:04:06
Shopify theme the theme is the big visual of how our store looks on the
4:04:11
outside so let's go to our Shopify dashboard and from here on the left side
4:04:17
we're going to click on online store the first link that we'll have is themes so this is the theme that we currently have
4:04:23
in our store it's called Dawn this is what it looks like it's a free Theme by Shopify and like I mentioned it's more
4:04:29
than enough to get started I'm actually going to work with this default theme and that's because like I said it's more
4:04:35
than enough if you scroll down a bit you can see other popular free themes that you can also use like Spotlight refresh
4:04:42
craft and they all have their own kind of look and style but mainly I want to keep it
4:04:48
super super simple we could also go with something like Spotlight because at the end of the day we're just looking to
4:04:53
highlight some products and make sure that they sell but we can also easily do that with the dawn theme so I'm going to go with that you guys can choose
4:04:59
whatever theme that you want the only recommendation that I have is do not put a budget right in the beginning because
4:05:06
themes are expensive they can go from anywhere between tens to even hundreds of dollars just for a theme that won't
4:05:13
even can help you get your first few sales because at the end of the day what the customers are looking for is are you
4:05:18
selling the right product to the Right audience so I mentioned this before but it really does not matter how your store
4:05:25
looks yes you do not want a super ugly store but the store that I'm creating you will not need more than that to make
4:05:31
your first few sales and like I mentioned reinvest your profits back into the business get better themes get
4:05:38
graphic designers to create your logos and Banners but I'm going to show you how we can do it Absolut absolutely for
4:05:44
free and save a ton of time and money Okay so we've got the theme first thing that we're going to do here is we're
4:05:50
going to click on customiz next to the theme that we see under themes under online store so I'm going to click on
4:05:57
customize and here we're going to have a few options the first one is the announcement bar as we can see here on
4:06:04
the top left so I'm going to click on announcement bar and that is the announcement that we're seeing here on
4:06:10
top of our store so most people most Shopify drop shippers and sellers
4:06:16
usually write something like free worldwide shipping or something like that you can write whatever you want there just make sure that it's nice and
4:06:23
welcoming and that it's just friendly and reaches out to your customers so what you're going to do is you're going to click on the text down here where it
4:06:30
says Welcome to our store and here on the right side we can edit the text that we see there so because my brand is
4:06:36
going to be called Prime jungle I'm going to use a text that kind of connects to that and it's going to say something like welcome to the jungle I'm
4:06:44
sure that now I got Guns and Roses stuck in your guys heads at least some of you so Welcome to the Jungle free worldwide
4:06:52
fast shipping let's edit that a little bit more so fast and free worldwide
4:06:57
shipping okay so Welcome to the Jungle fast and free worldwide shipping and you could add let a link to somewhere but
4:07:03
I'm not going to do that and that's it that's the announcement and now we're going to go down to the header so every
4:07:09
time I'm clicking on something you can see exactly what part it's responsible for here and in the middle so we can see
4:07:14
that the header is responsible for everything that we see here which is our store logo some of these links that we have which we can change when we'll do
4:07:21
the navigational menu changes further down in this course and here we've got the currency selector and to be honest
4:07:28
I'm not going to change anything over here if you want to make changes so you click on what you want to change here on
4:07:34
the left side here I can add additional blocks which in this case it's not really needed and here on the right side
4:07:40
you can make the actual changes so for example the desktop logo position which is here we can make it somewhere else
4:07:47
like if we choose top Center then it's going to be right here on the top which is also okay but it will make the
4:07:53
customer scroll a little bit more so I don't mind leaving it where it was let's just check out a few more options this
4:07:59
can also work and you know what let's just go with this so we've got the logo right here and we're going to change the
4:08:05
links here later on and that's it the currency converter everything else is in place so I'm going to go ahead and keep
4:08:11
this and everything else I'm just going to keep it as this so I'm just going to click on Save and we're done with the announcement bar we're done with the
4:08:17
header nice and fast nice and easy now we are going to scroll down to the image Banner which as you can see is this
4:08:24
default photo of a man and woman sitting down looking at the Sunrise or Sunset so
4:08:30
we're going to click on that and we are going to change the image here so you can see here on the right side it says
4:08:36
image Banner first image second image and we've got the overlay capacity and everything else so how are we going to
4:08:42
change this image let's refer back to the Drop Shipping cheat sheet again comment right below this video # Shopify
4:08:48
let me know what is your top takeaway from this video and I will gladly send you this cheat sheet with all of the resources and everything that I'm going
4:08:54
through all of the links but of course stay in the video because the video is much longer than the cheat sheet pack with much much more value the cheat
4:09:01
sheet is your extra bonus that you're going to use after you finish watching this video and you're ready to take your
4:09:06
first action steps okay so we are now making the store logo and the store banner and so we can see here that the
4:09:12
store logo is 200x 200 pixels and the store Banner needs to be 1,200 x 2,500
4:09:18
pixels now if you don't know what all this pixel Mumble jumbo is all about do not worry I'm walking you through everything so the store logo as you saw
4:09:25
right now there is no logo on my store it just says Prime jungle so we're going to make a new logo and the cover image
4:09:30
here which we are going to change as well so let's go ahead and do that right now we're going to start with the store logo so there are a few ways to get a
4:09:37
logo for your store the first one is using Fiverr now Fiverr is an online marketplace where Freelancers can do a
4:09:44
lot of work for your business of course this is a paid method so if you do not have the budgets aside you can move on
4:09:50
to the next method which I'm going to move on to soon anyway but I want to show you Fiverr so here you can search
4:09:56
for any service for example I want to search for logo creation and here I can
4:10:02
see a whole bunch of Freelancers that can do it for my store now these logos are definitely going to be better than
4:10:08
the free ones that we can make but we can still move forward with the free methods establish our brand get known
4:10:15
and then start to upgrade the look of our brand but in any case if you've got the budget right from the start if you want it to be super unique you can go
4:10:22
with one of these sellers here so you can see the prices down here for example this freelancer does it for $10 this one
4:10:27
for $20 and so it looks like the prices are ranging anywhere between1 to even
4:10:33
$160 but it really depends on who you are selecting you can see that each freelancer here each service provider
4:10:40
has reviews so this one for example jacqulyn has over 1,000 reviews 5.0
4:10:45
rating so she looks like a good option to start with but again I didn't even jump in and see what kind of work she
4:10:51
does I didn't see if that kind of branding aligns with what I'm looking for so of course you can click on it go
4:10:57
inside see a preview of some of their works and the way that they create their logos and see if that is the right
4:11:03
option for your business you usually have a few different types of packages so make sure that you see what each
4:11:09
package includes and that's it from here you're going to contact them you can try to negotiate you can try to see other
4:11:17
examples or to see if they can make something customized for your needs so get in touch with them get to know your
4:11:22
Freelancers and you can easily hire someone from here that can do the logo
4:11:27
work for you so that is option number one option number two is using canva
4:11:32
which I recommend because it's just easy to use canva and you can create your own graphic designs this way this has both a
4:11:40
free and a paid version so you can sign up fore free and start creating your own graphic designs and the paid things
4:11:47
inside you won't be able to use them like other types of graphics and stuff like that which I'll show you soon and
4:11:53
you've got hatchful which is free so I'm going to create two logos right now one through canva and one through hatchful
4:11:59
and I'm going to use the free methods the free versions of both so let's start with hatchful so I'm going to click on
4:12:05
that click on the link and here you can see that hatchful is owned by Shopify I'm going to click on create your logo
4:12:11
again this is absolutely free so use it on your Shopify store and okay so let's choose Let's see we are in I mean it's
4:12:18
pets but it's also not pets it's going to be a general store so in this case I'm just going to go with none of the
4:12:24
above so of course they were asking what kind of category you're in so that they know like what kind of tone to make for your logo so here it's choose your
4:12:30
visual style so is there something here that you really like that you kind of resonate with um I'm going to go with
4:12:36
maybe something like this like this strong over here then we're going to click on next okay now your business
4:12:42
name so it's Prime jungle and the slogan
4:12:47
so here's the slogan that I thought of I know it's not very original but Welcome to the Jungle best deals ahead something
4:12:56
like that or uh Welcome to the Jungle fast shipping low prices something like
4:13:02
that okay this is going to go on an online store so next and it like it
4:13:07
didn't even take a second so let's take a look at what we've got Prime jungle Prime jungle so these look look pretty
4:13:14
basic nothing too major and honestly I was even expecting them to create more
4:13:20
logos is that the whole amount let's try to kind of refresh this one yep that's
4:13:25
all that they created for us in my previous attempts they used to make a lot more logos but you just have to
4:13:30
choose one of these and continue with the editing process so let's say you would want to go with this one you would
4:13:36
click on edit logo and here you can choose the texts uh some slogans don't work in some of these uh logos cuz it
4:13:42
just doesn't fit the form format and you can change things like the fonts the colors uh the layouts and overall this
4:13:49
is going to create a free logo for your store and just get it started really quick the only thing that I would say to
4:13:54
take notice of is the colors that you're using you don't want your website to be way too colorful but you do want some
4:14:00
kind of a color schema going on just to get your brand recognized even more and the reason that we are really trying to
4:14:07
actually brand our stores and I talked about having brand customization when you're working with private suppliers
4:14:13
where you can send out the products with your logos on it the whole branding thing is really really important for
4:14:18
your stores and it's hard for drop shippers to Brand because as I mentioned usually when you're Drop Shipping you
4:14:24
cannot ask someone to send out a logo with your product because they will ask you to purchase a minimum order quantity
4:14:30
and then you're not Drop Shipping anymore but we want to stay with the Drop Shipping business model low risk and high reward so in order to do that
4:14:36
we can brand our stores in other ways so one we're going to create a nice logo and cover image for our store we're
4:14:42
going to send out email campaigns to our customers once we get their email addresses and we are going to keep everything branded so that they'll
4:14:48
actually remember where they bought this from I bought it from that website called Prime jungle that's what I want
4:14:54
my customers to resonate with and memorize and once that happens when you send out their products and their family
4:15:00
members or their friends look at it and they're like hey where did you get that from it'll be easy for them to say from a website called Prime jungle. store
4:15:07
rather than something that's hard to remember or that doesn't have its own domain name so it's going to be much harder to remember it it'll just be like
4:15:13
oh just some online website that I saw so The Branding is really good for the long-term effect of our business and we
4:15:19
all know the importance of branding we all know big Brands we use them we purchase from them and they give us a
4:15:26
certain feeling like for example Nike is a brand and their logo is just do it and there they connected with a feeling they
4:15:32
got you to feel yeah just go out there and exercise go out for a run go to the gym if you're thinking about it buy the
4:15:39
shoes if you're thinking about it just do it so that is kind of feeling that we are going to try to get through as well
4:15:45
and that is also a big big part of branding get your customers to memorize your brand and not only when they come
4:15:51
back to purchase from you they'll also refer their friends and their family and you are going to be making sales for a
4:15:57
much longer time rather than compareed to other websites who do not even try to Brand their stores okay I've said enough
4:16:04
about branding let's go ahead and continue with the logo and with the cover image creation so here with the
4:16:10
logo we checked out Fiverr we checked out hatchful which I didn't really like the results in this case and now I'm
4:16:16
going to go to canva which was my go-to anyway so the first thing that we're going to do is I'm going to start with a
4:16:22
cover image so with the cover image we can see that the resolution should be 1,200 by
4:16:28
2500 so create a free canva account click on file click on create new design
4:16:34
and here we're going to go with a custom size and that is what it's going to be so we're looking at a length of 1,200
4:16:41
and a width of 2, 500 so the width is 2,500 the height is
4:16:46
1,200 click on create new design and there we go so here we've got the open blank canva here is where we are going
4:16:53
to create our cover image now one thing that's important to understand is that we do also want it to be mobile friendly
4:17:01
the whole website needs to be super super mobile friendly and I'm going to make sure that it will be because around
4:17:07
half of our online Shoppers are going to be coming through on mobile and we've got this mobile phone view right here
4:17:12
where you can see what it's going to look like and as I move through the desktop and the mobile version you can
4:17:19
see that this cover image is being cut from the sides so for example here we can see the sun on the left Center
4:17:26
position and if I go to the mobile view you can see that it almost got cut on the left side so all the important
4:17:32
things need to be centered more and I'm going to take that into consideration when creating my cover image so let's go
4:17:38
ahead and get started I'm going to use the search function here on the left side and I'm going to search for
4:17:44
something around nature I want like a nature jungle kind of a background okay so here I've got the word nature
4:17:49
background I'm going to click on that and I've got a whole bunch of designs that I can use here and these are all
4:17:55
for free as long as we don't see this icon right here Pro then that means that it's included with the free version of
4:18:02
canva uh but instead of design I'm going to look for elements because I already have my basic design I actually want to
4:18:09
add an element so let's try again nature background so just kind of get creative and try to think about what type of
4:18:16
message you're trying to get across with your website and even though my website is a general one I am trying to kind of
4:18:22
brand it around the whole jungle kind of a feeling where you can find products in
4:18:27
the jungle where everything is like messy and Scattered and here's what's prime here's what we can find in the
4:18:33
jungle that will actually make a difference that stands out from the rest of the products again it took me just a couple of minutes you're going to put in
4:18:39
more work more thought into that but that is the general thought process that you want to go with so I noticed a whole
4:18:45
bunch of images here and like I mentioned the ones with the pro are not free and like I mentioned I do want to show you guys the free way of doing
4:18:51
things so I'm going to go with this one right here it's pretty clean it's doesn't have way too many colors I don't
4:18:56
want to go way too much out of context so I do want to keep it clean so I just clicked on the image and it popped up
4:19:03
here in the middle now I'm just going to drag it to make sure that it fits the whole image and it does okay very nice
4:19:09
so this is the main image now I know it kind of gets a little bit pixelated and blurry cuz we're way too zoomed in
4:19:15
nobody's going to be too this much zoomed in anyway so it's fine and now I'm just going to add some text so I
4:19:20
clicked on text right here and I'm going to click on title and I'm just going to make it a little bit longer so here
4:19:28
we're going to write the name of our brand so again it's Prime jungle and I'm going to space it right here in the
4:19:34
middle canva usually gives an indication of where the middle is and in this case it's right here and here but let's put a
4:19:41
little bit more on top so just about right here and we may come back and change this after we test it on the
4:19:46
website we'll see soon but uh we already got something going on so what I'm going to do now is here on the top you can see
4:19:52
that we have all these text settings I'm going to change the font I want the whole font of my website to be monserat
4:20:00
what is it called yeah monserat I personally really like this font um I see a lot of people using it in short
4:20:06
videos it's uh this type of engaging font so you guys can definitely inherit that as well so so I'm going to go with
4:20:13
the monster ad font and the colors are going to be a little bit more greenish
4:20:19
because of the Jungle okay so let's click on the colors right here and you can see photo colors which is good
4:20:25
because it takes the colors that we have here in the image and gives me them as options as well so I'm going to go with
4:20:32
one of the greenish ones maybe a darker green so it wouldn't blend in too much with the white background okay so this
4:20:38
one right here but again it's still looking kind of plain so we're going to add a few more text effects so I'm going to click on the text again and we've got
4:20:45
the effects button right here and I'm going to change it to maybe add a background that looks nice either this
4:20:53
or the outline which I like I like both of them I'm not sure which is the better
4:20:58
one I wish I could ask you guys what you think uh there's a whole bunch of other options here which I don't like as
4:21:04
Shadow is also okay but a little bit pler than I was expecting yeah so it's definitely going to be I like this but
4:21:12
it looks a little bit unprofessional I don't see any big Brands using such but this yeah this one will work a little
4:21:19
bit nicer okay so we're going to go with this and we're going to leave it centered uh I will probably make it a
4:21:24
little bit smaller just so that it will fit the mobile view as well and here is the center of the image and I would add
4:21:31
another text down here but I'm not sure if they will be able to see it let's try anyway uh so what did we say what was
4:21:36
that exact text Welcome to the Jungle fast and free worldwide shipping I see that it cross that it uh has a line
4:21:43
break which I don't really like so if there's going to be a line break let's make it after Welcome to the Jungle see
4:21:49
it doesn't do it automatically let's just put a lot of spaces and let's see if it does it nope it doesn't okay oh
4:21:55
that's a mobile view though the regular one doesn't have that it's only on the mobile view okay well that's not so bad okay so here Welcome to the Jungle I
4:22:05
could say something about the shipping but you know what let's just say Welcome to the Jungle they already see in the announcement bar and we don't want to
4:22:11
overdo things things so I'm just going to put it right down here and here I would also add another text effect so
4:22:17
let's click on that and maybe this time we can go with a shadow yes that looks
4:22:22
good okay you can easily mess around with more things more effects more settings but like I said I'm just going to do what is necessary to get started
4:22:29
I'm going to make this a little bit smaller so we can distinguish between that and the regular title that we have
4:22:35
on top place that over here and I think we're good we can start with this and see how that goes so I'm just going to
4:22:41
click on share over here then I'm going to click on download and the file format can stay as PNG we can see that the size
4:22:48
is our custom size and everything else looks good now I'm not sure if custom
4:22:54
size is also in the free plan if not you can just choose one of the preset banners that you have there and anyway
4:23:00
you can play with the alignments on Shopify so either way you can get this done okay so I downloaded this Prime
4:23:07
jungle image to my computer and now we can upload it on Shopify and see what it looks like so I'm going to go back to
4:23:14
our online store theme settings and we are going to click on the image banner
4:23:19
and we're going to go back to the desktop view okay so this is what we're looking at right now I'm going to change the image right here so I'm going to
4:23:25
click on select image I'm going to click on ADD images and I'm going to upload that image okay so here it is I'm going
4:23:32
to click on done and let's see what it looks like okay so here it is it looks pretty simple to be honest uh maybe I
4:23:39
would change the main text without having that background still got to think about that but in any case let's
4:23:45
see what it looks like so first of all I do want to change the text here so I'm just going to click on that and we can see that this is this text under the
4:23:51
image Banner I'm going to completely remove it I don't want to have any text here uh shop all is to go to our
4:23:58
products page we don't have to have that inside the cover image it's fine I'm going to remove the button as well if we
4:24:04
want to put it back later we always can okay so we can see that this is what the store is starting to look like and as I
4:24:10
scroll down we can see the two products that we imported but I still want to
4:24:15
play around with this cuz it just has a little bit too much scrolling it's a little bit too big so let's click on this image and we're going to scroll
4:24:22
down a bit so the first thing that we have is the image overlay opacity this is pretty much the darkness that we have in the image so the higher up I go you
4:24:28
can see that it goes dark and the lower I go it goes a little bit brighter I'm going to leave it at around what it was at 40% that looks fine the banner height
4:24:36
can be large small medium or adapt to first image I'm going to move it to either medium or small so let's kind of
4:24:43
play around with them both and see what it looks like so this is medium and if we go small small can also work I don't
4:24:49
want the customers to scroll too much I want them to jump into the action as fast as possible maybe I will Center the
4:24:54
text a little bit further down so that we won't have all of this white space here but let's go ahead and see what it
4:24:59
looks like on the mobile view okay so the mobile view did come through pretty well uh I might turn down the opacity a
4:25:06
bit so let's go back to the image and on the opacity maybe give it a 30% okay so
4:25:14
on the mobile view it looks good it's nice and centered I am just going to move the text a little bit further
4:25:20
down and let's try this version okay and the text is readable on mobile as well
4:25:26
so I will add another message down below so let's do that okay so Welcome to the
4:25:33
Jungle high quality products fast chipping it's a little bit
4:25:38
too long maybe we can ask our good friend Chad GPT to help us out here so
4:25:43
write a slogan for my business the business name is prime jungle my
4:25:50
e-commerce business the business name is prime jungle and the sentence should have something related to the Jungle
4:25:59
fast shipping high quality products Etc generate several more
4:26:08
slogans so there's a few good options here that we got from chat GPT regarding Logans uh I do like wild value and
4:26:14
Untamed quality I also like uh wild deals okay let's go with wild value
4:26:20
Untamed quality that's good all right so back to the
4:26:26
slogan wild value Untamed quality let's put a period
4:26:31
just to get a little more dramatic wild value Untamed quality yeah I like that okay I would still maybe do a few more
4:26:38
enhancements on this but overall it's okay we can get started with it okay okay so I'm going to download this
4:26:48
one and this is the one that we're going to go with so I downloaded it to my computer then I'm going to just change
4:26:53
the image right here so we're going to click on select from library we're going
4:26:58
to add another image and this time it's going to be this version click on done wait for it to
4:27:06
load okay so mobile view looks really good exactly on the center maybe we
4:27:11
should make it with less opacity cuz this one is really dark compared to the rest of the website maybe we can just
4:27:17
turn it down completely or maybe around 10% okay so that is the mobile view go
4:27:22
back to the desktop view it looks like this just want to make sure that it's small yeah it's small we don't want anything too big and the desktop content
4:27:29
position bottom center let's see what it will look like if we move it to the middle center it's not really going to
4:27:36
make any difference okay um overall we don't want to mess around with anything else down
4:27:41
here this looks good we are going to go with this I'm just going to go ahead and click on Save okay and let's continue so
4:27:47
guys the these aren't the only products that we're going to have on the store I will be adding more products and more categories further down in this video
4:27:54
course but I just want to move down everything step by step and keep everything relevant to its own section so right now we are done with the cover
4:28:01
image we will now move over to the logo and we do want to have around the same color ideas cuz we don't want all kinds
4:28:08
of crazy green colors or other types of colors on our website that will start to make it look irrelevant okay so we do
4:28:14
want to be professional now let's go with the logo so here we're looking at 200x 200 pixels so I'm going to go back
4:28:20
to canva and of course as I mentioned you can use the other methods you can use Fiverr you can use hatchful for your
4:28:25
logo and you can also use stock image websites for your banner so you've got some links to websites these free stock
4:28:32
image websites like pixels and like Shopify burst and unsplash all of these
4:28:37
websites are stock image websites that will allow you to use their image for free so here for example I could have
4:28:44
searched for the word jungle or nature or whatever and here you can see the results and I could have used these images as well in my opinion they're a
4:28:50
little bit too lifelike and maybe some websites will show you other examples but I am looking for something more on
4:28:57
the side of what I created even though I still could have used maybe this one for example there are some good options so
4:29:03
again guys those are all for free take advantage of what you have for free as you know because as I mentioned it's
4:29:09
more than enough to get our stores up and running to get our brand moving to making sales and profit it's way way more than enough okay so logo time so we
4:29:16
know that the logo needs to be 200 x 200 pixels let's go back to canva we'll click on file create new design and
4:29:22
custom size we are going for a 200x 200 if you do not have custom size just use anything that is close to that and we
4:29:29
are going with prime jungle again so I'm going to start by uploading the same
4:29:34
image that we had before because I do wanted to use the same colors so here what I can do is go back to elements and
4:29:42
click on this again maybe we can have this in the logo as well I'm not sure we still got to think about how to make our
4:29:48
logo nice maybe we'll add a couple of these leaves over here all right kind of rotate that a bit we can also put this
4:29:55
on top so maybe we don't need these yeah we don't need this and here
4:30:02
in the middle we're going to write Prime jungle again I do want to use the same tone that I used here so let's just copy
4:30:09
this and paste it over here yeah it's it's possible to do it okay and only this time I would change the effects to
4:30:16
something else because the logo is really small we got to make sure that the text is rather big we can see we're
4:30:22
still using the same font the mounts are at font and now let's just make it a little bit more visible maybe here we
4:30:28
can go with this one I'm still not completely completely
4:30:33
sure about this uh you know what this is always something that we can think about some more and I could
4:30:40
change it later but for now let's just go with this logo really quick and easy now I could add more elements from canva
4:30:46
like I could add like monkeys and uh animals all around but nobody's really going to see it it's a logo it's really
4:30:52
small I just want to make sure that the text is big enough for everyone to see and that is good enough for us so I'm
4:30:58
going to download this one so now that the logo is downloaded onto our computers we can add it to our
4:31:04
Shopify store now the logo is here under theme settings you can also find it if you click here on the heading where the
4:31:11
logo actually sides and it'll tell you to edit your logo in the theme settings but before that I do want to add a
4:31:17
footer image as well now this is definitely not a must but I'm going to add it because it's easy to do so and it
4:31:23
will make the website look a little bit better so I'm going to go back to canva this is the same as the regular header
4:31:29
image that we made so it's the same as this one so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to add another page and I'm
4:31:34
going to copy what we had here because I kind of like it and I'm going to paste it down here and this is the footer so
4:31:40
we can write something something different so in this case I'm going to copy this text right here and I'm going
4:31:46
to paste it here only here I'm not going to say Welcome to the Jungle because they were already in the jungle so I'm
4:31:51
going to go back to chat GPT and generate a few more slogans for the
4:31:56
footer of the website okay so footer friendly slogans fast shipping while
4:32:02
deals Prime jungle I like that even though we already use something um similar okay so these are pretty much
4:32:07
the same as the ones up here they're just a little bit shorter let's add another slogo so let's say fast shipping
4:32:14
wild deals Prime jungle now I don't mind having two different slogans one on the header and one on the footer I'm trying
4:32:20
to get the customer to resonate with the message that we are trying to send out and that is this is what prime jungle is
4:32:27
all about fast shipping wild deals okay so this is what we are going to go with so now I'm going to download this one as
4:32:34
well so this is the footer we can even give it a name over here next to the page so it'll make it easier for you to
4:32:40
understand what you are downloading loing so here instead of all pages we're only going to go with page two which is
4:32:45
the footer I'm going to click on done download okay it was downloaded now we're going to go back to Shopify back
4:32:51
to the footer so in order to get that image on the footer Well it can't really be in the footer we're going to put it
4:32:57
right here right above the footer so when we're going to go back to this section here on the featured collection
4:33:02
we are going to add another section and the reason that we're doing it here not on the footer is because the footer is going to limit the size of our image and
4:33:09
we don't want that so I'm just going to add an image Banner right here here okay and we're going to select
4:33:14
image just the same as the header so we're going to choose the image click on done and we're going to remove the text
4:33:22
we really don't need any of that so all of that is below the banner so I'm going to remove this and remove this and
4:33:28
remove the button okay and we can make it a little bit smaller we don't need it to be so big we don't want to make the
4:33:34
website as I mentioned have too much scrolling so I'm just going to make it small middle Center and everything looks
4:33:40
good we are of course going to check the mobile version as well so we're going to click on mobile and we're going to make
4:33:47
sure that we're scroll down fast shipping while deals Prime jungle okay looks good it just doesn't have the
4:33:52
opacity but maybe we can completely remove the opacity yeah I'm going to completely remove it keep everything
4:33:57
nice and bright okay so overall it's starting to look good it's starting to have some shape and now that we're done
4:34:04
with this we can move on to the logo that we created as well Okay so we've got the header image the products the footer image and everything else down
4:34:10
below we are are still going to play around with it like I mentioned a bit more a bit more optimization but now we're just going to make sure that we
4:34:16
have all of the important things okay so next we are going to go to the settings
4:34:21
the theme settings and here we've got the logo so here we know where the logo
4:34:26
is we're just going to add it click on ADD images should be this one okay so we're going to select the logo that we
4:34:32
created click on done okay and here is what it looks like now I am still going to change a few more things here um Okay
4:34:41
so here's my overall feeling overall the logo looks okay um maybe I'm going to
4:34:47
see how I can optimize a little bit more uh we're seeing Prime jungle and Prime jungle right away so maybe I will remove
4:34:53
it I will remove the prime jungle from the header we just don't need it to be repeated so quick uh we are going to
4:34:58
keep the next text that we have here and then the products and then this text okay so let's go back to the main header
4:35:06
image and we are going to remove the prime jungle and we're going to make this text much much
4:35:13
bigger and put it in the center and we're going to call it header and we're
4:35:18
going to download this one okay and we're going to replace this image simply by clicking on it and then
4:35:23
clicking on change over here select from library and I accidentally downloaded
4:35:29
both the images so let's go back to canva click on share again click on download on here we only need page
4:35:36
one since we have page two on the bottom which is the footer so download that and
4:35:43
re-upload it back to Shopify okay so Welcome to the Jungle
4:35:50
this is the mobile view and this is the website view it
4:35:55
looks like let's go back okay so the mobile view is good I can even make the text a little bit bigger I still have
4:36:01
room to make it bigger okay so let's just make it a little bit bigger and try this one again so there's a lot of trial
4:36:08
and error until we get it down right and that's also a part of graphic design but hey guys we're doing it for free we're
4:36:14
not paying anyone to do it for us and we're actually getting some pretty nice results okay so this should be the last
4:36:26
one okay so now the text is bigger mobile view is also nice this is the
4:36:31
mobile this is the desktop it all looks good so Welcome to the Jungle wild value Untamed
4:36:37
quality and we scroll down fast shipping while deals Prime jungle okay great okay
4:36:44
so overall our store is starting to take shape and form so we've got the announcement bar we've got the logo
4:36:49
we've got the cover image we've got the feature products which we are definitely going to change and optimize soon adding
4:36:54
more products in more categories and we've got the bottom cover image which is fast shipping while deals Prime jungle and we've got the subscribe to
4:37:01
our emails and things all of this we still are going to change it like I mentioned when we get to the homepage section so now we can go back to the
4:37:08
theme settings this is where we uploaded the logo and here you can can change the width so the higher you make it the more
4:37:14
pixels the more space this is going to take we don't want it to take that much space right here the header okay so
4:37:19
let's go back to the theme settings and as we scroll down we've also got favicon image so the favicon is you see this
4:37:26
little icon that right up here on your Chrome tab this is a favicon so right
4:37:31
now I'm on shopify's website so we see the Shopify logo inside the favicon so here you can upload the same logo that
4:37:39
you have and that's what they're going to see right there so even if it's not the size of the favicon it will be resized as you can see right here will
4:37:45
be scaled down to 32x 32 pixels so I'm just going to select the image and we're
4:37:51
going to select the logo which is already uploaded we're going to click on done and that is going to be the favicon
4:37:56
on our website as well okay now we've got the colors so here you can choose
4:38:03
what kind of a color schema you want on your website a little bit more advanced we're keeping it pretty simple at the
4:38:08
moment just kind of having this whole green and white kind of a Vibe so nothing too heavy but you can definitely
4:38:16
jump into this some more if you want you can say okay all of the text on my website I want it to be a certain color
4:38:22
and the background on everything should also be another type of color so again I'm not going to mess with this now you
4:38:28
can dive really deep into this so again there's no reason to do it now you can do it on your own time I'm going to keep
4:38:34
things simple typography is things like what kind of a font do you want to use on your whole website which in this case
4:38:40
I will change because I do know what fun I like and as you guys know by now it is
4:38:46
monserat so as soon as I click that you'll notice now that the texts here are going to change the text for the
4:38:52
links and the text here as well the featured products the title everything is using moner at which I simply like
4:38:58
more so I'm going to select that under typography and the font sizes the scaling and so other options that you
4:39:05
have here is layouts animations buttons and things like that I'm not going to go
4:39:11
to deep into it because again it's a rabbit hole guys once you get into it it's going to be very hard to get out and really you don't need to change
4:39:17
right from the start the thickness of the buttons and the opacity and all of those things leave it as is we are doing
4:39:23
only what's important to get our store up and running and start making our sales later on come back and do whatever
4:39:30
you want once you start to get more customizable with your website but again guys this is more more more than enough
4:39:37
okay so I saved all my settings and let's go see what our website actually looks like so far so I'm just going to
4:39:44
go to Prime jungle. Store free domain that I got from autods as you know and
4:39:50
okay I'm already seeing some things that need to be fixed and I'm not sure why we didn't see it on shopify's website
4:39:57
that's probably because I am running a 32 in wide screen and so things are looking a little bit different here so I
4:40:04
can already see what changes I need to make let me just go back to Shopify and see what the settings are on so right
4:40:10
now this this usual preview is probably around full HD that which is 1,920 by
4:40:16
1080 so that 1080p means that what we're seeing here is only on those types of
4:40:21
screens but I'm not using that type of screen and I do want to make it a little bit more Universal so let's click on
4:40:28
this image first of all first of all how's the logo the logo looks good okay it's in place I can see what it says I
4:40:33
can see the plants around that it looks good enough but if we look at this something here is off so let's see the
4:40:39
desktop content position is bottom center so that means that we're seeing more of the bottom of the of this image
4:40:45
which is not what we want so let's change that to Middle Center okay let's save
4:40:52
that and let's see if that makes a difference let's refresh our star nope that didn't change a thing okay so in
4:40:58
that case what we are going to do is simply edit the image on canvas some more so this means that the whole
4:41:03
Welcome to the Jungle we're going to move that text down a bit and while deals Prime jungle this text needs to be
4:41:09
smaller and also move down some more let's start with the first one so here we're going to keep the font size we're
4:41:15
just going to move the text down a bit this is going to be around here okay
4:41:21
and that should do it for this one so let's try this we're going to download this one only page
4:41:28
one which is the header and go back and update it right here
4:41:46
okay let's refresh all right there we go so now we have it all nice and in your face I could and probably will make the
4:41:53
text a little bit smaller because it's just way out of proportion so I'm going to do that and
4:41:59
that should be it so instead of 65 we're going to go with around maybe a
4:42:06
56 okay save that refresh our website okay there we go now it makes a lot of
4:42:12
sense so now I'm simply going to take what I did here and do the same for the bottom okay so the bottom the text
4:42:19
alignment it just needs to be a little bit further down but I do want the same font size as we have here so I'm just
4:42:24
going to so I'm just going to see what size we used here so this is size 56 and
4:42:30
by the way I didn't notice that the font is not monserat so let's change that as well there we go and let's also do the
4:42:36
footer as well so we're looking at moner at size 56
4:42:42
and we are going to move it further down below around this area I'm downloading each page
4:42:49
separately because it zips them up when you download both of them and I'd rather have it unzipped all right this should
4:42:56
be the last round so change okay and the footer
4:43:02
change okay we should be good now I'm going to save it and now we should be in
4:43:08
business okay Welcome to the Jungle wild Valley on tame quality then we got the featured products then we've got fast
4:43:13
shipping wild deals Prime Jungle everything is aligned correctly I like the way that it looks it does kind of get you into the whole jungle Vibe a
4:43:20
part of Nature and now we just need products we need categories and we need everything else there so let's go back
4:43:25
to the cheat sheet we went with a Shopify theme with a free one in this case it's called Dawn good enough to get
4:43:31
started the theme settings we added an announcement bar so again it's right up here Welcome to the Jungle fast and free
4:43:38
worldwide shipping I could even change it to one of these set is like wild value Untamed quality fast shipping wild
4:43:43
deals Prime jungle something like that but for now let's just leave it like that we did use the help of chat GPT to
4:43:49
think of a nice slogan so I asked Chad GPT in the prompt to make a slogan as you saw that's related to the jungle and
4:43:56
also selling products so you know put those two together and try to make it nice and engaging and interesting then
4:44:02
we went ahead and created our star logo so we know that the store logo needs to be at a resolution of 200x 200 pixels
4:44:09
and we went through Fiverr to look for Freelancers who can get the job done for us and also showed you how to do it in
4:44:14
the free methods using either canva or hatchful I didn't really like hash's
4:44:19
results you might like it for your business you might have better results than the ones that I got so I went on
4:44:24
with canva and it was really easy to get it done you can easily create a search for what you're looking for on canva and
4:44:31
search for it in either elements or design and you will be able to find a lot more things that you may need like
4:44:36
shapes Graphics are the ones that I use you can also use stickers photos and everything else that you see over here
4:44:42
so it's a really good and productive tool to use just make sure that if you're on the free version you're not using the icons that you see here
4:44:48
because you don't have them on the free version but as you see there is more than enough that don't have those icons
4:44:53
which you can also use so if you do not want to put the budget on this you certainly do not have to the images and
4:44:59
texts and the effects that I used here are from the free version just to show you what you can get done without paying
4:45:04
any money if you do not have that at the moment okay so after we did the store logo and the store Banner both that were
4:45:11
created through the free version of canva you also have the stock image websites absolutely free to use so if
4:45:17
you do not want to design any graphics and you don't want to pay anyone to do it for you just download an image that's
4:45:22
related to your content that's related to your brand to your website to your image using the free image websites and
4:45:29
we also went through typography choose a font that you really like that's not hard to read don't choose anything
4:45:34
that's like italic or cursive or simply hard to read just because you think it looks nice you need to remember that at
4:45:40
the end of the day someone is looking at your website and it needs to be super easy for them as well don't make the customers work too hard to understand
4:45:46
what's going on on your website and how to purchase a product that they are looking for so next you see that we do
4:45:52
have featured products so it's these two products and as I mentioned we are going to make them better we are going to add more products we're going to optimize
4:45:58
these even a little bit more even though we did do the basic optimization as you can see already inside the product page
4:46:04
you can click on whatever variant you want and all of this was imported to our stores within just a couple of clicks
4:46:10
with the product title and descriptions all written for us using the AI rewrite
4:46:15
tool and our store is starting to look good to go now remember to keep it
4:46:20
mobile friendly so I showed you plenty of times that I was always moving between the mobile version to the
4:46:25
desktop version to make sure that everything is in place and just because everything looked like it was in place on Shopify it wasn't actually in place
4:46:33
when I searched it when I went and opened up my website on my computer on my monitor because my monitor is a 32in
4:46:40
WI screen so I made it fit that as well now we did have to do a little bit back and forth on canva to make it fit but I
4:46:46
realized what was not working right I made the necessary adjustments and now everything is in place Pro tip before we
4:46:53
leave don't put too much time and effort into making everything look perfect first validate the product and make sure
4:46:58
that it's a winner before investing more time in resources so I really did try to put the minimum time that I need in
4:47:05
order to make my website look good and it's already starting to look that way and our next steps is to create our
4:47:12
Pages our blog our navigation menu so that we will have all of the pages that we need on the website like here we're
4:47:18
going to have about us and shipping policy we're going to have the return policy down here in the footer and some
4:47:24
other links so I'm going to easily create all of those pages frequently asked questions I'm going to show you how to create all of these legal and
4:47:31
also necessary pages that you need on your website and we're going to place them in our navigation menu I'm also
4:47:36
going to show you how to create a blog page and everything else and then our website will really start to take shape and form after that we're going to
4:47:42
install the best Shopify apps to complete and finalize our website before we move on to the marketing section
4:47:49
which is going to be really exciting because I'm going to show you how I'm going to record videos what came out of that we're going to create social media
4:47:55
accounts we're going to post those videos and try to get free organic traffic to purchase from our website
4:48:00
then we're going to double down on what works well from there and we're going to put a budget if you want if you have on
4:48:06
the videos that are working well organically to get even more sales from PPC or payer click marketing anyway I
4:48:12
know I'm going too far and too fast and that this video might seem a little bit technical but believe me I'm giving you the best and fastest way to get started
4:48:19
selling on Shopify but actually do it right so that you will make sales and profit so that is it when it comes to
4:48:25
website design and branding of course I will make much more optimizations as we move further down in this video course
4:48:31
for now make sure that you make your store look good get a nice logo up there a nice cover image the footer image is
4:48:36
really not a must but if you're already into it and you already created the header and you understand on how everything works and you want to put a
4:48:42
couple more minutes down for a footer image go ahead and do that because that will also look good just put it above the footer not inside because it will
4:48:49
make the image much smaller and that is pretty much it go ahead and create a nice website design with a good brand
4:48:55
and slogan for your business and I'll see you in the next section where we will create our Pages our blog our
4:49:01
navigation menu and more welcome to step number six of creating our Shopify store in Step number six we are going to
4:49:07
create our Pages our blog and our navigation menu and this is all of course mandatory to have it's a must
4:49:14
have before we launch our stores and get ready to start selling so it may not be the most interesting part of creating
4:49:21
your stores but again it is a must have this is where we are going to put down our policy pages so that our customers
4:49:27
will know what our shipping policies are what are the return requirements what are the terms and conditions frequently
4:49:33
asked questions and more we're also going to add additional Pages such as a track your order page so I'll show you
4:49:40
how you you can create a page on your Shopify store where someone can enter their tracking information and see
4:49:45
exactly what is going on with their delivery progress so it will show them all of the tracking events all on your
4:49:52
website without having to step out to anywhere else and once we get all of the pages complete we are going to assign
4:49:58
them to the navigation menu to either the header or the footer section of our website so that our audience will
4:50:04
actually be able to see these pages and have access to them and on top of all of that I'm also going to show you how to
4:50:10
write blog articles so I'm not just going to show you where it's done but also how it's done and we're going to
4:50:16
write one blog article together and you're going to continue this process for your store so here are some of the
4:50:21
required policies and pages that we are going to create one is a page called our story where we are just going to talk
4:50:28
about us our store our business our brand and get our customers to emotionally connect the other page is
4:50:34
called order tracking this is where as I explained our customers will be able to track their orders by entering the
4:50:40
tracking information then we're going to create a blog we're going to create a shipping policy return policy privacy
4:50:46
policy and do not sell or share my personal information now all of this boring legal stuff it's all pretty much
4:50:53
pre-generated for us so you don't really need to worry about how you're going to come up with this information so of
4:50:59
course I'm going to show you everything step by step we're going to get all of these Pages done and we're going to make
4:51:04
sure that they are assigned to our navigation menu and shown on our website so let's start off with the first one
4:51:10
and here is how we're going to arrange it in our navigational menu so in the header or on the top section of our
4:51:16
website we're going to have our story order tracking the blog and the shipping policy now the shipping policy is
4:51:23
questionable it's debatable you can also put it on the footer instead of the header but I do like having the
4:51:29
important information up for grabs and easy to find so I will put that in the header and then on the footer on the
4:51:35
bottom part of the website we're going to put the more boring stuff that people don't always get to but some customers
4:51:41
are looking for this information which will have our privacy policy returns and refunds frequently asked questions terms
4:51:48
of service and do not sell or share my personal information for those who live in the US this is a part of the law now
4:51:54
to have this page so we can get all of these policies pre-made for us for
4:52:00
example the Privacy the about us or in other words our story The frequently asked questions the shipping policy
4:52:06
returns and refunds in terms of service you all have links to them here under autods pre-made policies we also have
4:52:13
Shopify pre-made policies it doesn't matter which ones you use so Shopify has privacy policy terms of service and
4:52:20
refund policy so that's about half of what you can find on autod DS's pre-made policies in any case you're going to
4:52:26
just take this information from here for example if I click on autod DS's privacy policy it will take me to this page
4:52:33
right here where I can simply copy all of this information and paste it on my
4:52:38
website while of course changing an up dating the information like the business name and the address and contact
4:52:44
information and all of that what you have in these brackets you are going to update that according to your business's
4:52:51
information okay so of course I'm going to do this step by step with you guys but I want you to understand what these pre-made policies are and you can also
4:52:58
find them inside of Shopify already built in so you choose where you want to take it from so let's go ahead and get
4:53:05
started okay so as you can see here on the cheat sheet again comment down below # what is your top takeaway from this
4:53:12
video what did you learn from it and I am going to send you this cheat sheet with everything on it so right now you
4:53:17
can see that under Pages blog and navigation menu it says to navigate to settings and then policies for the store
4:53:23
policies with pre-built templates already inside and also you can navigate to online store and pages to create blog
4:53:30
and contact pages and let me just edit that because we'll also create blog
4:53:35
contact us and order tracking pages okay I'm just adding more and more of the
4:53:42
things that you guys really need to be able to get this store off the ground with everything already inside and only
4:53:48
the relevant things while leaving the irrelevant things outside so let's start off by creating a page and the page that
4:53:54
I want to create is the order tracking page so let's start off with that one and then we'll do the rest of the pages
4:54:00
so for order tracking on our Shopify dashboard we are going to click under online store on our Shopify dashboard
4:54:07
under online store we are going to click on pages and here you'll automatically see two pages that were created for you
4:54:13
one is do not sell or share my personal information and the second is contact which in other words is contact us so
4:54:19
now we're going to create another page so that our customers will be able to track their orders so I'm going to click
4:54:25
here on the top right on ADD page okay and here we're going to give a title to the page so I'm just going to call it
4:54:31
track your order or you can also call it order tracking but I'm going to call it track your order so that our customers
4:54:36
will it's just a little bit more straightforward you're going to track your order here here and it's not just general order tracking and here you can
4:54:43
write something before you get onto the tracking order field so here for example I'm going to write enter your tracking
4:54:50
information below to check the status of the delivery okay I'm just going to save
4:54:57
that right there okay so right now I can click here on view page and we'll just have a very blank page that has the
4:55:02
title and the text that I just wrote but here we actually need the field where they can enter their tracking information so how are we going to get
4:55:10
an add that so I added a link inside the cheat sheet under order tracking it's
4:55:15
called 17 track widget so I'm going to click on that and that's going to take me to this widget page right here so 17
4:55:21
track is a website that does allow you to enter Universal tracking information and it looks like this you just enter
4:55:27
the tracking number here and it'll give you information about that delivery now it supports lots of shipping carriers
4:55:34
around the world not just from the US but also worldwide but I don't want to send them outside to 17 back and then
4:55:40
come back to my website I want to keep them inside my website so in order to do that here we have the code this is an
4:55:47
HTML code that we get and I'm going to copy it okay so make sure that you're
4:55:52
copying from here from the top all the way until it ends the script here at the bottom and now I'm going to go back to
4:55:58
that page that I was creating so again I got to this page by clicking on this
4:56:03
link under order tracking it's called 17 track widget okay I was met up with this page I copied the HTML code and now I'm
4:56:10
back onto Shopify and under where I wrote that here I'm going to make a line break you don't need to write anything
4:56:16
if you don't want but I do like to have it a little bit more organized for the customer and so here we want to turn
4:56:22
into an HTML code in order to do that we're going to click right here where it says show HTML so I clicked on that and
4:56:29
here you can see the HTML that was made for me up until now so again I'm going to make a line break make sure I'm at the bottom and here I'm going to paste
4:56:36
that code okay so I pasted it right here and now we're going to go ahead head and click on Save okay so this new page was
4:56:43
created now we're going to click on view page again just to make sure that it was updated correctly okay so enter your
4:56:48
track information below to check the status of the delivery and then you got the track right here there are some irrelevant line breaks I think that I
4:56:55
noticed that here where we have all of these p and NP where there's nothing actually going on there so I am going to
4:57:02
remove that to see if it saves us another line break let's refresh yes and it did looks much better
4:57:09
now um okay so it's pretty much ready all you have to do is enter your tracking information here and get the info here okay so let's check and see
4:57:16
that it works so I'm just going to take some tracking information from one of my orders that already has shipping
4:57:22
information so just give me a second okay so this is a USPS tracking number I'm just going to enter it right here so
4:57:29
again it can be UPS USPS FedEx or any other even international shipping carrier it supports the bigger part of
4:57:37
them okay of course there are hundreds of shipping carriers but it will support all the major ones including this USPS
4:57:43
one right here so I enter the tracking here I'm going to click on track and you can see that it's loading here in the background and that's it you can see
4:57:50
that this one was shipped from into the US using USPS and you can see all of the tracking details here so it's all
4:57:56
happening on my website which is great and that is the way to embed it inside your page and to get that to work so now
4:58:04
we have a track your order page but it's not linked anywhere here because we didn't put it in the header menu or in
4:58:10
the footer so this one obviously belongs in the header but we are not arranging that yet let's first create all of our
4:58:17
pages and then we'll put them all in their respective places so we know that we have a track your order page and we
4:58:24
can move on to the next one so let's start with the first one which should have been our story okay so here we're
4:58:29
actually just going to create a simple page so we're going to go back to Shopify and again under online store under Pages we of course saved this
4:58:36
track your order page we're going to go back and we're going to create another page I'm going to click on ADD page and
4:58:42
here on the title I'm going to write our story so here I want to write a little something about us about me about my
4:58:49
business about my brand and try to get my customer to emotionally connect with me so in order to do that we are going
4:58:55
to write a nice little something today with the help of artificial intelligence that is exactly what we are going to do
4:59:01
so I'm going to open up chat GPT and save a lot of time and a lot of work doing it through here so I'm going to
4:59:08
write the following prompt write an about us page for my e-commerce website
4:59:16
the brand name is prime jungle and we sell a range of high quality products we
4:59:25
focus on customer service fast shipping we focus on great customer service fast
4:59:32
shipping great prices Etc right a nice
4:59:38
story for our our brand to get our customers to connect with us an
4:59:46
emotional level and I hope they're not going to overdo it but we can always kind of play around with the temperature
4:59:51
so let me see what we're going to get here welcome to Prime jungle at Prime jungle we believe that every purchase should be an experience one that makes
4:59:58
you feel confident excited and valued our journey began with a simple idea to create an online store where people could find high quality products at gr
5:00:04
prices without sacrificing fast shipping or exceptional customer service we started as a small team with Big Dreams
5:00:09
and those dreams were inspired by a love for Discovery and Adventure just like in a jungle I like that with every step
5:00:14
reveals something new and exciting we wanted Prime jungle to be a place where you can explore and find exactly I
5:00:19
really like where this is going it really took everything that I said and also got creative with the name Prime
5:00:25
jungle when you shop with us you're not just buying a product you're joining a family that cares about your satisfaction and happiness this sounds
5:00:31
great I like this let's listen to the second one welcome to Prime jungle where quality care and connection are at the
5:00:37
heart of everything we do our journey started with a simple aidea to create a space where customers could find top TI products we know that life moves fast
5:00:44
it's way matter Miss to deliver this one is also good I'm definitely going to go with the first one okay so I'm just
5:00:50
going to copy the text now of course you can mess around with it you can edit and you should edit and not keep everything
5:00:56
100% AI generated but for this quick store that I'm trying to create for you guys which is not coming out so quick so
5:01:02
far but I really want you guys to have everything that you need without all of the irrelevant stuff without all the
5:01:08
trash so we are going to start with with this so first of all I added all the text here but I do want to edit some of
5:01:15
the text at least the formatting of some of the text so here it's called about us welcome to Prime jungle I'm going to
5:01:20
make this the title so I'm going to click here on formatting and I'm going to make it heading one heading one is the title of the page I'm going to
5:01:27
remove the about us and I'm just going to keep it like this welcome to Prime jungle and remove this spacing issue
5:01:33
here and everything else looks pretty good another thing I could add is after they finish reading down to the end I
5:01:39
could say you know hey here browser selection of high quality products with a link to our product page but we can
5:01:45
always do that later because I still need to make some changes to some of these pages but anyway now that we're done we're are going to click on save so
5:01:51
it only took us a couple minutes to get a nice little our story page and if you scroll down to the bottom you'll always
5:01:57
notice that there is a search engine listing preview so this is good for SEO purposes to make our website stick out
5:02:03
to make people be able to search for us and find us through Google now it's probably not going to happen through the
5:02:09
art story page page but you can always click here edit website SEO and you can tell Google okay what you want the SEO
5:02:16
title to be as well as the meta description so right now what it's doing is it's just going to take it from from
5:02:22
our H1 title this is called the H1 and it's going to take the text here as The Meta description and it might not look
5:02:28
that good because as you can see right here the sentence kind of finishes off here even though it's still going so
5:02:35
it's kind of getting cut off in the middle of a sentence but again this is not a page where people are are most likely going to find us through Google
5:02:41
we are going to implement more sdo practices on the blog okay so this is
5:02:46
good enough we save the page now let's go back so now we already have a couple of pages that we just created one is
5:02:52
called our story and the other is called track your order with tracking information embedded inside let's create
5:02:59
the rest of our pages and then we will set them we will organize them inside our navigation menu okay so we're done
5:03:05
with our story in order tracking now let's move over to the blog the rest is going to be super super easy but the
5:03:12
blog does have a lot of creativity that we're going to need to add inside and you don't have to have a Blog but the
5:03:18
reason that I really recommend to do so is because you are going to write articles about the products that you're
5:03:24
selling and what you're going to do here is focus on SEO on search engine optimization so that Google will be able
5:03:31
or whatever search engine your customers are using most are using Google so that if your customer is searching for
5:03:36
anything that's relevant to the product that you're selling and you wrote a really good article on it then they are
5:03:43
going to find it when searching on Google and if you did a really good job you're also going to be on page one and you're going to get a lot of free
5:03:49
organic traffic by doing so and this is a free organic marketing method that you
5:03:54
can use really easily to get traffic on your website and this cold traffic turns
5:04:00
to hot traffic really quickly when you make a good connection between that blog article and the item that you're selling
5:04:06
that really connects with the problem that that customer was having and so let me show you exactly how this works and how to do it the right way so back on
5:04:13
the Shopify dashboard here under online store instead of pages this time we are
5:04:19
going to click on blog posts and as you can see we do not have any blog posts for now we are going to create one and
5:04:26
the topic is going to be around one of the products that we're selling and then we're going to use that as a call to
5:04:32
action to our product page to have our customers purchase those products so I'm
5:04:37
going to write an article on these products right here and I will start with the portable alarm door stopper
5:04:44
even though it doesn't really matter what we start with and again it really depends on how well you did on the article that you wrote I'm going to give
5:04:50
you all of my best tips and also if there is a general interest in this type of product so I want to get people to
5:04:57
come to this page to get here from Google and I'm going to do that by writing blog articles that are related
5:05:02
to this product so you don't have to write a blog article about portable alarm door stopper because there are not
5:05:07
a lot of people who are searching for that but you can kind of see the search traffic by even going to simple places
5:05:12
like Google Trends and see what people are searching for so if I go here to Google Trends okay and I search for a
5:05:19
portable alarm door stopper nothing right even alarm door stopper by the way
5:05:25
I'm going to make the results worldwide okay so there's like no interest in this whatsoever but if I search for something
5:05:31
a little bit more broad that's still connected to this like home security this is a topic that a lot of
5:05:37
people should have an interest in and you you can see right here we shouldn't be looking at uh the past day we should
5:05:43
look at the past 5 years okay so while there was a huge increase during 2019
5:05:50
and ever since then there was a small decline but still ever since then it's been staying pretty steady over here people are always always looking for
5:05:57
home security and that's much more than they're looking for alarm door stoppers which is pretty much nothing okay so
5:06:05
again it's home security and you can take it even further by just searching for things like security okay which is
5:06:11
always always always at the top look at the interests and it will never drop below this because people want to feel
5:06:18
secure and you can also search for other broad topics such as alarm and you can see that a lot of people are searching
5:06:24
for this people are always interested in these topics and this is something that I want to try and Tackle through my blog
5:06:30
so I want to get some of these people who are searching for home security who are searching for alarm systems who are
5:06:35
searching for ways to lock their doors I want them to find my blog article that's going to write all about it so let's go
5:06:41
ahead and do that now so we clicked on blog posts and we clicked on add a blog post so now we're creating a new blog
5:06:47
post we got a title here we got the text here when we're done we're going to click on Save and we have a Blog article
5:06:53
that's ready so let's actually start writing this article I'm going to start by going to chat GPT and there's a few
5:06:59
things that you can do first you need a list of topics second you can also kind of get that by searching Google and see
5:07:06
what other blog articles are writing around these topics okay so let me take
5:07:11
both of these examples and get ideas from both places so here on Google I'm going to write home
5:07:17
security okay and here I got PC Mac the best home security systems for 2024 so we have a comparison article that's
5:07:24
testing different types of home security systems same thing for here New York Times so we got all the big Brands right
5:07:30
here writing about the best systems okay and that is what we are pretty much getting here but I'm not getting exactly
5:07:37
I'm not looking for the product I'm looking to get more information about it okay so what we can do first of all is
5:07:43
we can write a comparison article comparing between different types of alarm products and making sure that our
5:07:48
alarm product is number one on the list this is the best one and then you have all these other ones but I want it to be
5:07:55
a little bit more informational it's a little bit quicker to create and when you get down and dirty on the subject and you're going to have more time to
5:08:01
spend on it than what I am here when I'm teaching it you can also do a comparison type of article so here I'm going to
5:08:07
look for home security maybe I ideas and here here are 11 ways to secure your
5:08:13
home set up the security system secure the doors lock the windows so here you're giving someone information 11

5:08:51
get some ideas from these articles so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to take the top three articles on Google
5:08:57

5:09:02

5:09:40
purchase that product so this is obviously an affiliate blog but their second page on Google because their
5:09:46

5:09:52
other products only except for the first one which is the alarm door stopper and
5:09:57
the third blog article let's see what they did so here they're just giving out tips and do they have any affiliate

right number here might be if we do a Google search we can see that they gave here 11 and 20 and 20 and these are the

5:18:13
did 11 second place on Google was 20 third place was 20 and then we are down
5:18:18
to 10 so I'm going to do 12 just to kind of stick out and not look like everybody else and perhaps take this spot right
5:18:26
here anywhere in the top three that's going to give me a lot of traffic especially because I know a lot of
5:18:31
people are searching for home security and home security ideas okay so let's go with that blog article we checked out
5:18:38
what are some of the best practices are doing on Google those that were able to rank well and get successful and we also
5:18:43
talked with chat GPT a bit and we know that we are going to go with 12 simple home security ideas and instead of you
5:18:50
can Implement today I'm going to change that title okay so what I'm going to do is because that you can Implement today
5:18:56
is fine but I'm going to go with something that will make you feel more secure more confident okay so I'm going
5:19:03
to tell chat GPT let's go with this one okay and I pasted which one we're going
5:19:08
with with change it to 12 instead of 10 ideas write down the list of ideas or
5:19:16
the list of 12 ideas and the product is renamed to alert Guard
5:19:24
Pro okay so now we took one idea and we are diving into that one expanding it
5:19:29
further brainstorming the ideas and of course we're going to cross check it with the blog articles as well all right
5:19:35
so 12 simple home security ideas you can Implement today oh I didn't tell it to also change the title but we did get the
5:19:40
ideas here okay install motion sensor lights upgrade to Smart locks and secure doors and windows with reinforced locks
5:19:47
use the doorbell camera so these are all pretty much used products and products and products set timers for lights and
5:19:54
electronics install a security camera system add an extra layer protection with alert Guard Pro so here they're
5:20:01
adding Us in the seventh place I would make this first place so I can always change it of course they're trying to
5:20:06
like elegantly put us somewhere there in the middle middle but if you don't have links to any products up until here and suddenly on seven you have a link to a
5:20:13
product I'm just going to Showcase it as number one and you can do it down below you can give them all the value first
5:20:18
and then be like hey buy this product but what about those who didn't make it to the end of your article so it's okay
5:20:24
to say this is our most biggest recommendation and then give them the rest of the value that they need okay
5:20:29
trim shrubs and bushes around your home I'm not sure why let's see why overgrown plants can provide cover for intruders I
5:20:36
didn't think about that create a neighborhood watch now Network that's a pretty cool idea use a dog as a deterrent lock your garage and sheds
5:20:43
well that should go without saying and display security signs okay so let's take the next step let's start writing
5:20:49
this article but I also want to get some ideas from here like secure the doors lock the windows we already understand
5:20:54
that don't forget the garage it's just like they could have said all of those three into one lock
5:21:01
down your Wi-Fi network that's one that we can also add eliminate hiding places this is also a good tip and adding
5:21:07
security cameras okay so let's start writing this I will change a title in the end but 12 simple home security
5:21:13
ideas that's what we're going to go with and we'll brainstorm the second part later let's add the first part here 12
5:21:21
simple home security ideas okay and let's add to keep the burglars away okay
5:21:29
and now I want to go a little bit deeper into what chat GPT did here so let's start with taking what they wrote here
5:21:35
and making the following changes alert Guard Pro should be number one and I
5:21:41
want to give it more info about the product so let me give chat GPT the info
5:21:46
for this product we're just going to copy what we wrote on the product page should be number one please make it more
5:21:53
informational and sellable here is the product
5:22:00
description write out the whole section for this part and I'm going to paste the
5:22:07
description right here okay hopefully chat GPT understood me okay so what it's
5:22:13
doing here and that's what I didn't want it to do is it kind of wrote a product
5:22:18
description instead of writing around why you need to boost your home security
5:22:24
so let's just rewrite that and it's all a part of writing the right prompt so what I'm going to do here is I'm going
5:22:30
to tell chat GPT this sounds more like we're trying to sell the product rather
5:22:36
than provide valuable information and getting the reader to understand why
5:22:45
they need please rewrite it under an informational tone to bring value to the
5:22:53
reader as to why they need it right let's try that angle it's going to start
5:22:58
like this enhance your security with the alert Guard Pro a simple but powerful solution when it comes to protecting
5:23:04
your home and personal space taking simple precautions can make all the difference one to that can signific ific L improve your security whether you're
5:23:09
at home or on the road is the alert Guard Pro here's why it's an essential add-on to your home security plan okay
5:23:15
so this is all great okay so this is a much better start added protection for all types of spaces deter shoters before
5:23:22
they get in Easy tool for installation portable and convenient heavy duty and reliable why it's worth considering and
5:23:30
all of the descriptions below look pretty good okay so this is great it it is kind of sellable like it is very much
5:23:37
trying to sell but it's also providing a lot of information around the product and why they need it and what's so good
5:23:42
about each feature that it has and this is just doing a much much better job but it is very markety so on second thought
5:23:50
I will put it as number two so maybe number one will be not a product that we're trying to sell but rather a tip
5:23:57
like trim shrubs and bushes around your home okay I'm going to make that number one and then number two will be the
5:24:03
product okay and then the rest will just be the rest of um the infos and tips that we have here and so that's it when
5:24:09
it comes to creating a Blog you do have to get a little bit creative and think about what the reader or what your
5:24:14
online Shopper might be going through and don't just think about what you think is right and wrong because you
5:24:19
haven't done this before and you don't have the data yet and when it comes to writing blog articles it's very very
5:24:24
flexible you can do pretty much anything you want but you want whatever you are doing to be the right strategy and in
5:24:31
order to do that you don't want to tell the customer here I'm pushing something in your face because this is what I want
5:24:36
you to do you have to get them to understand you have to get them to decide for themselves to come to their
5:24:41
own conclusions and decision that they need this product so we're going to do that by giving them a freebie a nice
5:24:47
little tip they're going to be like oh yeah trimming brushes and bushes I didn't think about that because honestly I didn't think about that either for
5:24:53
myself and if someone would tell me hey you know if you trim down bushes and and and shrubs around your home burglars
5:24:59
won't have too many places to hide when they're outside looking in right and okay so thank you I just learned
5:25:04
something from you so you seem like you know what you're talking about and now you're going to recommend hey you know you can also this product is also a
5:25:11
great oh really what what is it oh it's it's a door stopper oh great okay well you just need to know what you're doing
5:25:16
you did give me some pretty good tips okay so yeah give me that product and that's what we're trying to do here I
5:25:21
mean it's not black and white you can also put it in the middle so you can give four tips and then Market the product but again most readers are not
5:25:28
going to stand till the end of the blog so you have to start off strong keep them engaged hook them in reel them in and then give them the offer make them
5:25:35
understand why they need it okay so with that strategy in mind that is is exactly what we are going to do so we got line
5:25:41
number two which is this one and while it says it's number one it will be number two so let's go back to creating
5:25:48
our blog article and here I'm going to paste it down here as the second option okay and the first one well first you
5:25:54
need the title so let's paste the title right here and let's make sure that it is in H1 and we do need an introduction
5:26:01
before we jump into it okay but we're going to get to that later first let's finish with the list okay so let's ask
5:26:08
chat GPT to write about trim shrubs and bushes around your home okay so here I'm
5:26:14
going to say expand further on trim bushes and shrubs around your home and
5:26:19
we're going to do this expand further on every one of them now you can tell J GPT you know just write the whole article
5:26:25
and and then I'll just because it'll get to too many words too many characters and it won't be as good I do like to
5:26:30
take each section and get CH gbt to think further on it so it does take more time but it will give you better results
5:26:37
and as you can see here it's getting pretty long we really don't need to have such a long description for each one so
5:26:43
I'm going to change it to make it a little shorter and make sure the content
5:26:49
is not or will not get flagged as AI generated which is also a good tip to
5:26:56
have okay because while it is difficult for Technologies to understand what articles were written with the help of
5:27:02
artificial intelligence or not it's still always good to try to uh hide it especially if we're not going to do a
5:27:08
lot of editing because we're trying to do a lot more things this is not our main profession here but we do want to get that done so that we will rank on
5:27:14
Google and that we will get traffic but we do also want the information to be good okay so here is the next one so the
5:27:20
first one is trim shrubs and bushes around your home simple landscaping for better security so I'm just going to
5:27:26
leave the second part out of it okay cuz I just again I don't want it to be too long and here we have all of this text
5:27:33
here and the second we'll talk about the alert Guard Pro so that is good I could make this a little bit shorter it's
5:27:39
still a little bit too long but let's kind of go over it real quick so while Landscaping adds Beauty to your home overgrown shrubs and bushes can create
5:27:45
security risks by providing hiding spots for intruders by keeping your your yard well maintained and training back large
5:27:50
plants you can enhance both the safety and appearance of your property here's how this simple action helps remove
5:27:56
hiding spots improve visibility maximize security lighting so we're already talking about this when we do recommend
5:28:03
about adding more lighting so I will take this part out just to make it shorter cuz I don't want repeated content and prevent access to Upper
5:28:10
floors so you trim trees so that they won't be able to climb on it and get to your upper floors okay good enough not
5:28:16
super short but not very long but very also informational okay so we're going to keep that and then here on the second
5:28:22
one we are going to link to our product page for the product that we are trying
5:28:28
to sell another thing that you guys can do while you do see that I am making some edits here and there there are
5:28:33
other free tools out there that can rewrite whatever you're writing to make it seemed less AI generated even though
5:28:40
those tools are also AI at the end of the day get inside make some changes here and there just to make sure that
5:28:46
Google won't flag it as AI generated now lots of Technologies say that they know what is AI generated and at the end of
5:28:52
the day they don't really know so this whole thing is still kind of new to the world but I do recommend going inside
5:28:58
and making some changes here and there even though Chad GPT does not copy and paste answers from one user to another
5:29:03
it's still always good to add some human touch inside okay so now that we're on product number two to let's go ahead and
5:29:09
link to our product page so let's get to it really quick so this is our product page this is the URL it's very long I
5:29:16
don't like it uh we can always change it later I can show you how to do that when we get back to the uh product page
5:29:22
optimization but for now I'm just going to copy this URL because even if we change it it's going to create a redirect from the old to the new so it's
5:29:28
okay to use this link let's go back to the blog and it's here second one with alert Guard Pro so first I'm going to
5:29:35
take that title In The Heading and I'm going to make that a link to it so here we are going to link to here okay this
5:29:42
is called anchor text where we take text and we turn that into a link and another option that we have here is open this
5:29:47
link in the same window I don't need to open it in a new window cuz it's not taking them to a different website it's staying inside my domain I don't mind up
5:29:54
being in the same window okay and I will add the link again here on alert Guard Pro so I'm going to click on insert link
5:30:01
add the link right here okay and make sure that it's linked at least one more time somewhere down
5:30:07
here here here we go okay so they'll get the point they
5:30:14
understand that this will be a link to that product and that they will be able to purchase it and so that is number two and here is how we're going to make
5:30:20
sales here's how we're going to use this as organic traffic to be able to make the reader convert and become a customer
5:30:28
by giving them the info that they need giving them the confidence that they need and the understanding that this
5:30:33
product is going to make their lives more secure now the next thing that I'm going to do is make sure that I got my
5:30:38
formatting correct so we got the title right here as a heading one and everything else the titles will be
5:30:44
heading twos so I'm just going to click on that I'm going to hover and I'm going to click on heading two and as you see
5:30:50
the text Will became a little bit bigger because now it is a heading two the reason that we need all of these headings is it makes it easier for
5:30:57
Google Google has a crawler okay it's a piece of technology that crawls our websites and tries to understand what it
5:31:03
is about so one of the things that helps that is giving it the formatting so it knows okay this is a heading this is a
5:31:10
title before we get text that will explain more that will elaborate more that is connected to that heading so
5:31:17
formatting is a great way to help Google's crawlers understand what the website is about what the blog page is
5:31:22
about so people are going to search for it or something similar to it Google will know okay this piece of content will also help because we know that it's
5:31:28
about this this and that okay another thing that we also need to tell chat GPT is that home security ideas is also the
5:31:35
Focus key phrase for this article so we want this Focus key phrase to show up a few times in the article so we can
5:31:41
already do it now by kind of looking around here so we got the Focus key phrase right here at the start while
5:31:46
Landscaping as Beauty to your home overgrown shrubs and bushes can create security risks by providing hiding spots
5:31:52
for intruders so here we can add it to the end of the sentence here's how this simple action helps we're going to change it to here's how this simple home
5:32:00
security idea helps right so we just kind of changed the wording there and we added our Focus keyphrase which is home
5:32:07
SEC ideas and the more we write this inside this article naturally don't make it sound too Force Google will
5:32:13
understand okay this word has been repeated a few times in the article we understand that this is kind of what the article is about okay so let's also do
5:32:19
that here enhance your security with alert article Pro a simple powerful solution so when it comes to protecting
5:32:25
your home or personal space here I can change that as well so when it comes to home security ideas to protect your home
5:32:35
or personal space taking Syle okay so you see what I did there the sentence makes sense we're not messing up the grammar but we are adding our Focus key
5:32:42
phrase as much as possible and yes I am saving the page as I write just to make sure that nothing will go unsaved and
5:32:49
I'm also going to add it here to the last sentence so it's a small change that delivers peace of mind so I'm going
5:32:55
to say it's a small home security idea that delivers peace of mind and the rest
5:33:01
of that sentence okay so that's way that way we're kind of forcing that focus keyphrase in there we're doing it smart
5:33:06
and after we write the blog article you can see that it's already looking good it's already looking informational we can of course add images I'm going to
5:33:13
show you how to do that as well and I'm also going to do it under the heading for this product okay so here I want to
5:33:18
add an image I'm going to click on this insert image button right here and I can use an image that we already uploaded
5:33:25
and I'm going to use this one right here I'm going to click on done okay so that is one way to also add images to your
5:33:31
articles if I click on preview you can kind of see what it looks like okay so I'm just going to scroll
5:33:37
down here and there we go so we got the image here and you got to admit images look much better than having a whole
5:33:44
bunch of text now because we do have a title I see that shery now does that automatically so we do not need two
5:33:50
titles so we can remove the first one but it's always always good to test these things cuz it wasn't always this
5:33:56
way now I kind of mess up the formatting so let me click on that and make sure that this is a heading too okay we still
5:34:02
need to write an introduction before we start all of this but still it's looking good let's save this this one other
5:34:08
thing that I noticed is the bullet points you can see that there is this line break which shouldn't be there so let's try to understand why that is
5:34:15
happening and that's probably because it was copied and pasted so here I'm just going to create one manually and that
5:34:22
should help let's see if it helped with the first one so formatting and stuff like
5:34:28
that is always something that we're going to have to learn how to fix let me just un bullet list them save that
5:34:37
preview now okay so now there's no bullet list now let's highlight them and
5:34:43
give them a bullet list with shopify's internal tool only not everything needs to be bold it's only up until here it
5:34:51
does look like there's a little formatting issue let's do it without highlighting everything and it will turn
5:34:58
them all to it okay so next time we copy text we're going to make sure to do it without text formatting and I'll show
5:35:04
you how to do that but for now let's just try to overcome what just
5:35:11
happened okay there we go now I can see that it's
5:35:18
good it's not making everything Bold and the formatting should be fixed now okay so we're going to save this we're going
5:35:23
to preview and now there should be no line breaks there we go okay so now it looks good uh here there's an extra line
5:35:30
break let's make sure to hide that it's right here there we
5:35:35
go okay so let's continue with the rest of the ideas we still need to add 10 more ideas I'm going to do it a little
5:35:41
bit quicker this time cuz you guys get the idea let's just make sure that the links also work so we got the link right
5:35:46
here alert Guard Pro you click on it you get to the product where you can purchase it okay so same thing here we
5:35:51
added the link it works and we also added the link down here click on it and it works okay great now let's just fix
5:35:59
again here there's the text formatting issue let me just tackle that really quick and that is the last time that
5:36:04
we'll be copying and pasting without fixing the text format first so the way that we're going to do that is next time
5:36:10
we're copying from here we're going to copy and when we paste it here we are going to go with paste and match style
5:36:17
or paste without formatting depends if you're using uh Windows or Mac and that way you're going to have to return all the bold wordss and stuff like that
5:36:23
you're going to have to do your own formatting but you won't have to undo and redo you'll just have to redo okay
5:36:29
so let me just add them in again really
5:36:35
quick okay saved let's give it a quick preview and it looks much better now
5:36:42
okay so I do feel that this is a little bit too long so we're going to look for some things that we might want to remove
5:36:48
but first let me write about the rest of the products we might leave it because it does make it look pretty good but
5:36:53
let's just add the rest of them and then take a look at how everything looks only this time we will be pasting without
5:36:58
formatting which would be the right way to do it and when it comes to me when I write blog articles for my stores I
5:37:06
usually have a virtual assistant that helps me get the blog writing done for me I show them where they can research
5:37:12
the Articles from the best practices like the websites that I showed you they create a quick brainstorming session okay we should have these headings
5:37:18
inside which is kind of what Chad GPT did for me and then we break down each section so everything that I'm telling chat GPT to do I have a personal virtual
5:37:27
assistant who's doing that for me but if you don't have that luxury which I'm sure that you don't have that in the beginning just use chat GPT and use all
5:37:34
of the extra tips that I'm giving you to avoid plagiarism and to make sure that the text is good relevant and that the
5:37:41
text formatting is also on point okay so let's get back to it and I'm going to continue with the rest of the blog
5:37:47
article I'm not going to have you guys watch me do the rest of the steps because it's all the same as everything that I just did and I'll see you when
5:37:54
I'm done and I'll show you the whole preview of everything that I did if there's something new to learn I will let you know until then I'll see you
5:38:00
when I'm done so now I'm writing keep it short and informational elaborate more on install Mo motion sensor like and I'm
5:38:07
going to keep the same prompt for the rest of them so keep it short and informational elaborate more on X keep
5:38:13
it short and informational elaborate more on Y and then we're going to write the introduction we're going to write a quick conclusion and we're done with the
5:38:19
first blog
5:38:29
article all right so I pretty much finished writing the whole blog article I'm on the last one at 12th one so you
5:38:35
saw everything in fast forward and now you can see how I'm going going to kind of finish this off so as usual I've been
5:38:41
pretty much copying and pasting according to my instructions so the prompt was keep it short and
5:38:46
informational elaborate more on and the on is whatever topic we are writing and
5:38:51
I am on number 12 right now of the simple home security ideas so the last
5:38:57
one is display security signs so I'm going to copy and paste that one as well so I'm going to copy from chat GPT of
5:39:04
course edit your text make the needed change here I'm going to paste and match style
5:39:10
or paste without formatting as I showed you it's just going to mess up the formatting if we don't do it this way so I want you guys to see it one time how
5:39:16
I'm doing it so first we've got the title for the heading so that is the H2 heading we're going to separate the rest
5:39:22
of the text from that so that this what what we see before and after won't uh accidentally turn into a heading as well
5:39:28
it's just text formatting things that you guys will pick up along the way and I'm going to kill this extra line break which we do not need but you see that it
5:39:34
did turn everything into a heading to as well which we do not want so I'm going to cancel that and I'm just going to
5:39:39
stand on this sentence right here and I'm going to do a backspace so sometimes you have to come up with these ways that
5:39:45
will fix the formatting issues because at the end of the day it's text it's HTML and we do have to kind of mess
5:39:51
around with it so this is the title and then here we have the transition sentence moving you down into the
5:39:57
bulleted list which starts from here so I'm going to make this part bold and I'm going to start a bulleted list right
5:40:02
here and here is the second part so I'm going to backspace it until here then I'm going to press enter it's going to auto automatically create the next
5:40:08
bullet list I'm going to put this in bold and this is pretty much what I have been doing so I'm using my keyboard hot
5:40:14
keys to make it uh quicker and easier okay so this is pretty much what
5:40:20
I have been doing while it was on uh fast forward and here is the finished
5:40:26
product or almost finished I'm just going to kill these extra line breaks make sure that everything is on point
5:40:31
and now we just need a conclusion and an introduction for now let me just save this let's give it a quick preview
5:40:38
okay you can see it right here so here are the 12 steps and the second is the product that we are trying to sell and
5:40:45
we've got the rest of the information so here I can see another line break which we don't need so let me just search for that part really quick it's going to go
5:40:52
I'm going to go back here and here it is right here so I'm just going to cancel that I'm going to save I'm going to click on preview again and we're going
5:40:58
to search for that same exact spot to make sure that there is no extra line break which there isn't so right now
5:41:04
we're continuing to check and test ourselves and everything else looks right on point when it comes to the text
5:41:12
formatting okay here's another line break right here so right before simulate
5:41:18
occupancy we got this line break here which is too much kill that preview test
5:41:24
it again so here's how you're testing yourself to make sure that everything is on point which now it looks like it is
5:41:31
and here's another one right here this line break here
5:41:40
and yes I am doing it one by one to make sure that I don't miss anything okay this seemed to be a repetitive problem
5:41:45
to almost each and every one of them I can see it again
5:41:55
here and again here okay so fix whatever formatting issues you have make sure that
5:42:02
everything looks professional and that there is nothing that stands out so another thing I could do is add more
5:42:09
images but it's not a big must because I got the main message through which is what I wanted to now at the end of the
5:42:15
day you just want people to be spending time on your page if they're getting good information here then they're more
5:42:20
likely to stay another thing that I noticed is that there is a space between the bulleted list right here but for the
5:42:26
rest of them there isn't so I need to kill the spaces here this is before I was doing it before the text formatting
5:42:33
so let's just fix that really quick it only happened here
5:42:40
and this looks like it's going to be an easy fix there we
5:42:47
go and now everything is together okay great so here we have a nice little blog article that walks you through the top

home and loved ones each strategy from installing this to that plays a vital role in detering the potential Intruders
5:45:17
among these measures the alert Guard Pro stands out as a crucial tool for personal security and here we're going
5:45:23
to link to it again so I'm going to copy all of this and I'm also going to copy the conclusion because that is also a
5:45:29
heading as well so copy that go back to our blog article scroll down to the
5:45:34
bottom and give it the conclusion that it needs right down here so again paste without formatting the conclusion is
5:45:41
going to be a heading two and again I turned everything to a heading two so we need to separate between them so I'm going to make a line break hover over
5:45:47
that again give it a heading to and bring them back up so besides conclusion
5:45:53
we can also write things like final thoughts and I will give it another paragraph break right here among these
5:45:58
measures the alert Guard Pro stands out as a crucial tool let's put all of that
5:46:03
inside the anchor text all linking to to our product
5:46:08
page uh this is the preview so I don't want to link to the preview page let's go to the actual page itself Prime
5:46:15
jungle. star/ product/ portable alarm door stopper so that is going to be the
5:46:21
link to this anchor text now you can make anchor text don't make it too long but it needs to be
5:46:27
relevant so if I click on this I understand where I'm going to go so alert Guard Pro stands out as a crucial
5:46:33
tool it's going to link to that tool then it makes sense but you don't need to have the whole sentence or two
5:46:39
sentences as anchor text linking to somewhere it's just too much and that is not the format that people are used to
5:46:45
seeing okay so this article is finished now I'm going to save it we can give it
5:46:50
a quick preview and we can see that everything is in place and this one is ready to be
5:46:56
published it's a great article and you can actually learn quite a lot from it even though it was generated mostly by
5:47:01
artificial intelligence so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to change the visibility of this article from
5:47:07
hidden to visible and I'm going to save it now again not everybody can see it yet but soon when we start adding it to
5:47:13
our navigation menus everybody will be able to see these pages so what are we going to do next let's go back to the
5:47:20
cheat sheet and we know that we have a Blog Page so we did the r story we did
5:47:26
the order tracking page and we did the blog page so all of this took some time it took some effort especially the blog
5:47:32
but you now have unique pieces of content that most other drop shippers simply do not not have especially when
5:47:38
it comes to writing a Blog and a lot of people get turned off by the blog because it's like oh I'm not a professional writer I can't write so
5:47:43
many things and I hope that I showed you that you don't really need to you just need to know where to find the information you need to know how to find
5:47:49
the patterns of what worked well for other people and Implement those same practices while adding in your own
5:47:55
little twist that's going to make the big difference and soon we'll see if the blog is going to be able to generate me free organic traffic to my website to my
5:48:02
product page and see if we're going to make any sales that way that is one of the free or organic marketing tips when
5:48:08
we're going to jump into the marketing section soon in this video but when we get to that and I'm going to show you
5:48:14
the other marketing methods that we're going to do this is going to be one of them so I'm going to reference back to this part of the video if you want to
5:48:20
learn how to create a blog article or a blog page for your website that will give you free organic traffic and also
5:48:27
how to brainstorm plan and execute that blog article to make sure that it really comes out good with all of the relevant
5:48:34
information inside so last but not least we are going to scroll down to the website SEO part and make sure that SEO
5:48:41
here is good because this is why we're actually writing this article so the page title is the SEO title that is
5:48:47
different than the title that we have up here this is what we call the H1 title the H1 title is a title that we'll see
5:48:53
inside the blog article but that is not the title that we have to see when we're seeing this page on Google or whatever
5:48:59
search engine that we're using there we can have a different title for this article only here I can keep it the same
5:49:05
12 simple home security ideas to keep the burglar away I'm going to leave that as the SEO title as well but the meta
5:49:13
description it's not too good because it doesn't really have the list here or anything close to it it's just this uh
5:49:19
introduction that's kind of being cut off so what we can do here is edit the meta description so I'm going to go to
5:49:25
chat GPT for this one and ask it to write a good one so back to chat GPT write a meta description for this
5:49:33
article including the list of ideas okay so discover effective home security
5:49:39
ideas to protect your family and property this article covers 12 practical strategies including installing motion sensor lights and
5:49:46
utilizing the alert Guard Pro for added security enhance your home safety today looks great I'm going to copy that go
5:49:52
back here and I'm going to use this as a metad description and this we don't even need that last sentence I can see that
5:49:57
it's being cut off anyway so this is the metad description and this is what it's going to look like on the search engine 12 simple home security ideas to keep
5:50:04
the burglar away then we got the URL right here which by the way the URL we can make it shorter and we will just
5:50:10
using the focus keyphrase which in this case is home security ideas we don't need 12 simple in the URL we don't need
5:50:15
to keep the burokers away in the URL so it's just going to be home security ideas also I'm not sure if I wanted
5:50:22
under SL news we will change that soon when I'm going to show you how to change the Blog name and it's going to create a
5:50:28
redirect anyway you see every change that we're making here is kind of creating a redirect it's fine to do it now as long as we're not getting any
5:50:33
traffic anyway so it's just going to be slash home security news and we'll make
5:50:38
more changes later but for now we can save that and now we have a much better meta description and we have a better
5:50:44
URL and overall this is going to catch on much better on Google search engine or any other search engine that our
5:50:50
Shoppers might be using okay so now let's move on so before we finalize the
5:50:55
blog and let it do its thing we can add a featured image as well so here I can add any featured image this is like the
5:51:02
main image that people are going to see before they enter the blog like even if they see it from Google Google can use our featured image and show it there as
5:51:08
well so here you can add your own featured image it's going to be the image of the product okay so it's the
5:51:14
door lock okay so I could use this image as the featured image although most people
5:51:20
will not really understand what this is even though from this you can see that it's kind of like an alarm so it is a
5:51:26
product that has to do with it now you could use other images you could use images of like thieves like running away
5:51:31
like in the middle of a burglary or something something that will get the customer to be like oh okay I understand
5:51:37
what this is I see how it connects to the title and everything of course needs to be relevant in this case I'm just going to leave it as this so I'm going
5:51:43
to use this image and we are going to save it so here on the blog we also have
5:51:48
world the blog's name so news is created by default and the more you create the
5:51:54
more you'll be able to see them down here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new one and I'm just
5:51:59
going to call it Prime jungle okay then I'm going to click on Save and you can see that this article is now a part of a
5:52:06
Blog called Prime jungle and now in the URL you can also see that it's Prime
5:52:11
jungle. star/ blogs Prime jungle slome security ideas so that is going to be
5:52:17
the URL for this blog article and that's good enough now this article is good to go and we're going to put that aside
5:52:24
with the other pages that we already created which is our story order tracking and you now know how to write a
5:52:29
blog article and this is a great way to bring free organic traffic to your website and later in this video when I
5:52:35
get to the market section and I'm going to show you the free organic and also the paid way to Market your website to
5:52:41
Market your brand to Market your store and get it in front of the right target audience this is going to be one of
5:52:46
those methods I'm going to tell you to refer back to this part of the video to learn about how to write a blog and get free organic traffic and of course
5:52:53
there's going to be much more methods that I'm going to show you when we get to the marketing section but I did just reveal and show you how to do one of
5:52:58
them but believe me the marketing section is going to be super super exciting and you're going to learn so much from there okay so now that we got
5:53:05
the more difficult Pages through the rest is going to be pretty easy so let's create a quick shipping policy return
5:53:11
policy privacy policy and do not sell or share my personal information which was created automatically by Shopify as well
5:53:18
as the privacy policy okay what am I talking about so let's go back to Shopify and here we are not under blog
5:53:25
posts anymore we can go back we can simply click here on pages and here are the pages that we have so far so there
5:53:32
are two pages which were created automatically by Shopify contact and do not sell or share my personal
5:53:38
information so I'm just going to edit the contact page really quick so I'm going to click here on view page and
5:53:44
here is the contact us page it's already on the header section of the menu we're going to get to the navigation menu soon
5:53:49
but first let's see what we can change here so this is the preview of the
5:53:55
page and if I click on it not on the preview I can actually edit what we see here now while I cannot edit these
5:54:01
fields like name email phone number comment we can leave it as is right but we do want to let's say change what it
5:54:07
says up here or add some text here in the middle now if you still want to change the fields that you see here you
5:54:13
can go to the Shopify App Store and search for contact okay so for example go to Shopify App Store okay and search
5:54:19
for contact or contact form okay and you can use one of these especially the free tools and just make sure that it's free
5:54:26
and not just a trial for two days and then you have to pay money because it's not really going to be worth it especially not at the beginning but this
5:54:32
is where you can make a contact form that's going to be much more customized with your logo and your graphics and
5:54:37
whatever text you want in the fields and all of that we definitely do not need that yet that is an Overkill and I'm
5:54:43
trying to keep this video and underkill so that you can create your store get all the important things up there and
5:54:49
start making yourselves in profit so this page given to us for free by Shopify is more than enough only here
5:54:55
instead of contact maybe we can change it to contact us or stay in touch or
5:55:01
anything creative that you can think of I'm just going to leave it as contact us and here in the content I'm I'm going to write let us know what's on your mind
5:55:09
we'll get back to you before you can say rme Jungle of course that is just adding
5:55:17
in a little bit of humor and it's even some dead humor if you ask me but I'm still going to add that anyway and I'm
5:55:23
going to click on save it just sounds a little bit more personalized a little bit more like we care and now if we
5:55:28
click on view page you can see right here so contact us let us know what's in your mind we'll get back to before you can say Prime jungle okay then they've
5:55:34
got the rest of the fields right here so just just to make sure that it works I'm going to write my name here I'm going to
5:55:40
write my email address phone number I'll leave it blank and comment hey Lon this is just a test I'm going to send that
5:55:48
message so where is that message going to get sent to and that is the email address that you have at hand which is
5:55:54
right here under your Shopify dashboard you're going to click on settings and under general settings you've got your
5:56:00
email address right here so for me it's dros shipping gurus I think I meant to write Drop Shipping gurus rul and I
5:56:06
missed the P there um but I don't want my customers to read Drop Shipping anyway so I will create another email address and I will use it for this
5:56:13
website and of course you can use a Gmail because you're a small business and it's fine you don't need to have your own domain on your email yet even
5:56:20
though you do have a store domain which is much more important but further down the line you can definitely register for your own email hosted domain but let me
5:56:27
open my Gmail really quick and there we go new customer message so we can see right here by Prime jungle and if I
5:56:34
click on it you can see that the message which is right here country code us Naman and okay comment Hal run this is
5:56:41
just a test so here you can also reply to your customers from your email and if I write to it then it's going to go to
5:56:47
my other email my Lon autod dias.com email because this right here is the dro shipping guru's email as you can see
5:56:54
this is where I registered my Shopify store and you can always change it as I showed you in the general settings so here I'm going to write thanks I got it
5:57:01
and now I'll be able to test and verify that the contact works both ways Okay so I sent the message now I need to open my
5:57:07
other email my Lon aod s.com because I said that that's what what my email is when I was writing the message on
5:57:13
contact us and here it is new customer message and if I click on that thanks I got it so now I know that people can
5:57:20
send me a message and I can reply back to them and of course it works but I will create another Gmail just for this
5:57:26
website so let's do that really quick we're going to click and add another account and then here we're going to click on create
5:57:33
account okay and your name is Prime jungle and we've got some results here
5:57:40
because people already use prime jungle but I'm going to create my own and let's call it maybe Prime jungle
5:57:48
store yes we have that all right let's create a quick password quick phone verification it's
5:57:56
okay if you've already used this phone on other emails it will still work okay and my recovery
5:58:01
email okay so all very simple and now we are in so so I've got my new Gmail it's
5:58:07
Prime jungle store gmail.com I'm going to go to Shopify to the general settings and I'm going to update the email right
5:58:17
here and now the contacts will come through here so in any case we've got the contact us and we saw that that it
5:58:24
worked and we know how to change our email in case we didn't like the email that we signed up with so the contact us
5:58:30
page works and it's been edited to our liking the next is which by the way I
5:58:35
see that it's not written here so it's contact us okay now let's do the policies so shipping policy return
5:58:41
policy and privacy policy so let's do those real quick as you see right here we've got the autods pre-made templates
5:58:46
you also have Shopify pre-made templates so let's say we're going to do the shipping policy you can click on the autods shipping policy right here and
5:58:53
you've got the shipping policy right here where you can copy and paste and just change the info that you see here
5:58:59
like your website address or business name uh your total shipping time and all of that now for Shopify Shopify doesn't
5:59:05
really have a shipping template here but you can also see the internal templates that they have so if we go back to
5:59:11
Shopify and here we're in the settings okay so again we're going to click here on settings and here at the bottom you
5:59:17
have policies so here are shipping policies that Shopify already created for you and I think it's going to be
5:59:22
easier to work from here so here I'm just going to click on shipping policy and you can write the policy here but
5:59:28
again it's not really pregenerated at least not in this case so we are going to have to use another shipping policy
5:59:34
so that is why I recommend going with the auto deal shipping policy so I'm just going to copy everything from here
5:59:39
and I'm going to go back to Shopify and paste it here under settings SL policies
5:59:44
SL shipping policies okay so I pasted all the info here here you don't have to paste without formatting you can do it
5:59:50
with a formatting it should work fine and just change the info in the brackets and add any other relevant info so here
5:59:55
for example thank you for visiting and shopping at insert website address or business name so I'm just going to write
6:00:01
Prime jungle okay and kind of put that in bold the following are the terms and conditions that form ulate our shipping
6:00:06
policy so first is a shipping processing time so we ship directly from multiple warehouses as soon as the order is processed if we're experiencing a high
6:00:13
volume of orders it could be a little bit delayed okay and then you've got the shipping rates and delivery estimates so this is what customers are looking for
6:00:19
and this is why more most of the reasons why they came here so shipping charges for your order will be calculated or
6:00:24
displayed at checkout we're giving free shipping so we're not going to use that sentence it really depends on the store that you're making but I recommend
6:00:31
giving free shipping worldwide as I showed you also how to do so I'm going to remove that sentence
6:00:37
and right here are the estimated delivery dates after purchasing after
6:00:43
completing your purchase okay so the first one is Us 2 to six business days
6:00:49
um this is only if you're shipping from into the US in my case it's coming from China although I will try to Source it
6:00:55
from the US but if I can but until I can see if I can do that or until I search for other products from into the US I
6:01:01
will change that to 7 to 14 business days so change and add more if needed we
6:01:06
will try to expedite it as much as possible delivery delays can
6:01:13
occasionally occur okay so us is 7 to4 and worldwide okay or International will
6:01:20
be 14 to 31 business days okay shipment configuration order tracking a tracking
6:01:26
number will be added to your order you can ALS you'll also notified via email and I'm also going to write that they
6:01:32
can also track their order from our website and in order to see what that link will be we can go back to our
6:01:37
Shopify dashboard okay we're going to go to Pages under online store we're going to
6:01:45
go to the track your order page and we're going to view it this is
6:01:50
the URL for our order tracking page and we're going to add that as well so a tracking number will be added to your
6:01:56
order details as soon as they are available let's just reward it so as soon as the tracking number is available
6:02:01
it will be added to your order details it will be notified via email so that you can keep track of the delivery status every step of the way you can
6:02:07
also track your shipment progress here and then on here I'm going to leave the
6:02:14
URL to our track your order page so you can also track the progress
6:02:20
of your shipment here okay great custom duties and taxes so here Prime jungle is
6:02:26
not responsible for any customs and taxes applied to your order all fees impulse during or after shipping are the
6:02:31
responsibilities of the customer if the package is returned to us due to unpaid customs taxes or return to the sender we
6:02:38
will refund the cost of the product and retain the shipping charges which in this case won't really happen because shipping is free damages if you receive
6:02:44
damage merchandise please take a picture and email the picture to us at and here you're going to insert your email
6:02:49
address so here in our case it's Prime jungle store at gmail.com right away we
6:02:56
will only replace damage Goods within 48 Hours of receiving your order so of course you're going to change all of this text around according to what your
6:03:02
supplier can give to you and I know that our all Express sellers can give us those refunds so it should be fine and
6:03:08
so now we have our shipping policy set so very easy to get a shipping policy up and running especially once we make the
6:03:14
little tweaks and adjustments to customize it to match our business's terms okay so next now that we're done
6:03:20
with the shipping policy we are going to move to returns and refunds so again you got a link to how to create a policy
6:03:26
there but Shopify is creating some of these for us so let's go here to return
6:03:31
and refund policy and here you can see this button right here insert templat so they already created a template that can
6:03:36
help us out and I clicked on it so we have a 30-day return policy which means you have 30 days of receiving your item
6:03:42
to request a return so this is true and of course you have to match this with what your supplier can give you whatever your supplier gives you if they give you
6:03:49
60 days give your customer 60 days as well if they give you 14 give them 14 if they don't give you any at all I would
6:03:55
recommend to negotiate with them or find another one that does but also don't give it to your customers if you're not
6:04:00
getting it yourself okay so in our case all they express they will give us a 30-day return policy so that's also fine we'll keep it here here to be eligible
6:04:06
for return your item must be in the same condition that you received it unworn unused with tags in its original packaging also the same as AliExpress to
6:04:13
start a return you can contact us at Prime jungle store gmail.com so you see you may notice that they already added
6:04:20
the email address that we updated that's inside our Shopify settings slen so as
6:04:27
soon as you update this they already updated their templates with that email as well so that's why it's important to
6:04:33
update that field so you can contact us at this email please know that returns will be need to send to the following address I'm going to remove this because
6:04:40
I will supply them with a return label okay so I'm going to remove that sentence if your return is accepted we'll send you a return shipping label
6:04:46
as well as instructions on how and where to send your package items returned to us or sent back to us without first
6:04:52
requesting a return will not be accepted you can always contact us for more information at our email okay then we got damages and issues I'm just going to
6:04:58
kill these line breaks which they added too much of them so certain items cannot be returned like perishable Goods custom
6:05:04
products this is all very well aligned with AliExpress's um policies K exchanges European Union 14-day cooling
6:05:10
off period so they must return within 14 days that's just something with the European Union and refunds will notify
6:05:16
you once we've received and and inspected your return okay so overall everything here is on point we can go
6:05:22
ahead and click on publish and that is the return and refund policy now regarding wait who's going to pay for
6:05:28
the return is it free does the customer pay so it really depends on what your supplier can give you as well so you're
6:05:34
going to notify the customer depending on what item you sold depending on what supplier you used but it's important to have this return and refund policy just
6:05:40
to help them understand how many days they have to return the product okay next after to returns and refunds is
6:05:47
terms of service so let's go back to the templates that we have here to the written policies we've got terms of
6:05:53
service right here and we also have an insert template button so we're going to use that and we're going to go all the
6:05:59
way up now we're not lawyers but this pretty much covers what your customers need to know when it comes to terms of
6:06:05
service so this website is operated by Prime jungle throughout the site we means so okay this is all the legal
6:06:10
stuff and basically you can just go through this really quick and see if there's any changes that need to be made
6:06:15
like here for example they want us to link to the refund policy so that's the policy that we just created right now so
6:06:21
we're just going to go to policies and once we link this into our online store menu we'll have the link to that so
6:06:28
let's just leave that open right now after we do the navigation menu we'll have the links to these pages and as we
6:06:34
continue scrolling down again link to the refund policy so we're going to fill that in later once we have the link and
6:06:40
here we are going to link to our privacy policy which we haven't created yet so we will have to come back to our terms
6:06:45
of service after we create the rest of our policy pages but besides that we should be in the clear okay so here
6:06:52
contact information Prime jungle store gmail.com our contact information is posted below it's the same so I'm just
6:06:58
going to remove that and leave it here Prime jungle gmail.com business address phone number registration number and vat
6:07:05
number number we already have that information under General so here is the business address I'm just going to copy
6:07:11
it and paste it here business address business phone
6:07:17
number okay and we should be good I'm going to click on publish okay and last but not least we've got the privacy
6:07:23
policy now the privacy policy is also automatically generated by Shopify and it also updates automatically which is
6:07:29
pretty cool so we don't really need to change anything here you can see that I've got use automated policy on and it
6:07:36
just syncs with shopify's latest updates so we can just leave it as is we don't really need to worry about that and just
6:07:42
let that update automatically so that was an easy one and now we've got all of the important Pages besides the
6:07:48
frequently asked questions now frequently asked questions here you're going to cover a whole bunch of questions that your customers might ask
6:07:55
like when am I going to get my order where are the orders being shipped from what is the quality of the products how
6:08:01
can I return the products so it's good to have this page as well so let's go ahead and create that page so we're
6:08:07
going to go back to Shopify online store Pages we're going to create a new page
6:08:13
so add page and we'll call it frequently asked
6:08:18
questions and here we're going to write all of those frequently asked questions so here I'm going to get the help of my good friend chat GPT to help save time
6:08:25
create a fact frequently ask questions page for the e-commerce website the name
6:08:32
is prime jungle here's some of the information shipping is 7 to 14 days to
6:08:40
the US 14 and 31 International returns are accepted
6:08:47
within 30 days after delivery tracking
6:08:52
information will be uploaded as soon as possible tracking information can be
6:09:01
checked on our track your order pay page and add any other relevant questions SL
6:09:10
anwers that customers usually ask so we gave chat GPT some of the information
6:09:16
and we expect chat GPT to also get creative and give us the rest okay so here are the questions so far we've got
6:09:22
10 okay so 10 questions what is the estimated delivery time how can I track my order what is your return policy how
6:09:28
do I initiate a return only here they said please visit our return page and follow the provided in uh instructions
6:09:33
which is actually true we did create a returns page and we did tell them to email us with the information do you ship internationally what payment
6:09:39
methods do you accept which is true major credit cards PayPal and other secure payment options can I change my order after it's place please contact us
6:09:46
what if my order arrives damag let us know within 48 Hours how can I contact customer service at support Prime
6:09:52
jungle.com of course we're going to change that do you offer discounts or promotions yes sign up for our newsletter which is true and that's it
6:09:58
if you have any questions we'll be happy to assist so we're just going to take all of this and it's a pretty good one we can definitely start with this
6:10:05
frequently asked questions okay so this is going to be our header so we're going to make this The Heading one and these
6:10:12
questions can be heading twos and you can also create heading
6:10:17
threes if you need but here we don't really need you can create heading fours you can create as many headings as you need and just kind of make a hierarchy
6:10:25
right to all of your topics H1 is the title H2 is the first in the hierarchy
6:10:31
and it starts continues going down from there okay and just this email right
6:10:36
here so it was um Prim jungle gmail.com and everything else is on
6:10:42
point we're going to click on Save okay and we easily created a frequently asked questions page within 5 minutes okay
6:10:49
next we are done with all of the policy Pages we are done with creating a Blog we're done with creating an order
6:10:55
tracking page our story and everything else the last thing that we'll need is do not sell or share my personal
6:11:00
information but that is already created for us so I'm going to show you all of that so just to sum it up we've we got two places where we are creating Pages
6:11:07
there is the one way where we go to the settings and then there we have the policies so that's like the shipping policy returns privacy policy and those
6:11:15
stuff that we were able to generate and also generate some for ourselves and the other one is navigate to online store and Pages where you can create the blog
6:11:21
the contact us and their order tracking page the rest are going to the policies okay so those are the two places where I
6:11:27
showed you where you can create these Pages some belong in the policies and some belong under Pages now we're going
6:11:32
to link to these places on our website so that people will actually know that it exists and they'll be able to go to
6:11:38
those pages and get the information that they need so we're going to split that to two places as mentioned we've got the
6:11:44
header and we've got the footer the header is the top of our website the footer is at the bottom of our website
6:11:49
so under header we are going to add our story order tracking blog and the shipping policy and the rest is going to
6:11:55
go under the footer menu so how do we do that back to Shopify we're going to click under online stores instead of
6:12:02
pages one under that is called navigation so we're going to click on that and by the way I don't know if this
6:12:07
is bothering you guys I can remove the password now but I'm going to do it soon anyway so yeah let's just do it soon so
6:12:13
here we've got the footer menu and the main menu let's start with the first one the main menu and here you can see that we already have three links one is
6:12:19
catalog and one is contact so if we go to the website we can also see that here so if we just go to the main page you
6:12:26
can see here home catalog and contact so this is the header menu we also have the footer menu which for some reason is not
6:12:32
being seen and I'm going to show you how to activate that soon but let's start with the header menu first so you can give it a title main menu no one can
6:12:39
really see it I'm not sure if I want the home there but we can keep it because a lot of websites usually have that and I
6:12:45
don't see any harm in having a home you can even click here to go home you can click here it'll just take you to the
6:12:50
main hom page so we're just going to leave that there the next is catalog I don't really like that word so I'm just going to click on edit and here I'm just
6:12:58
going to rename catalog to products okay then we're going to click on apply changes and next contact I'm also going
6:13:05
to change that to contact us and you can already see that it's leading to the contact us page so if you click on that
6:13:11
you can say what you want that to link to so click on apply changes and you can also see the same for products so you
6:13:18
you can see that product under that has all products you can click on that to let Shopify know where you want it to link to so you can link to a Blog blog
6:13:25
post policies and so forth but that is not the place for that so so far these three places created automatically by
6:13:30
Shopify are already linked to the right places I just changed the menus titles okay so let's see what we need to add
6:13:36
there we need to add the page called our story okay so let's go back here we're going to click on ADD menu item and here
6:13:42
we're going to write our story and we're going to click here to tell Shopify where we want it to link to so here it's
6:13:48
under pages and it's a page called our story okay and I'm going to click on ADD and I'm going to put this first before
6:13:55
everything else I'm going to drag it right after home so we're going to have home our story and then products we can
6:14:00
have products and then our story let's just see how it kind of plays out and let's see what else we need there so our
6:14:06
story and we also need the order tracking okay so let's add that order tracking page and I'm going to put that
6:14:13
you know let's do products first and then order tracking and then our story
6:14:18
contact us okay so let's click on ADD menu item and this is called track your
6:14:24
order and here again we're going to click on pages and this is a page called track your order and we're going to
6:14:30
click on ADD and this is going to be after products because in my mindset
6:14:35
let's say they go to the homepage they'd go to the products they' purchase a product then they'd want to track the order they might want to read our story
6:14:43
before everything so we still might make it before but again let's see how it plays out we're going to click so far on Save menu and we also need to add the
6:14:50
blog and the shipping policy as well I might put the shipping policy on the footer menu if we have too many links
6:14:56
here again it really doesn't matter that much as long as your customer knows how to get all these answers they can also get it from the free live chat which is
6:15:02
what I'm going to show you guys in the next section with we get you the best free Shopify apps I'm going to show you how to add a live chat to your website
6:15:09
absolutely for free and other essential Shopify apps that are free that you have to have that will help you get more
6:15:15
sales okay so let's add the blog as well so back to the menu add menu item and
6:15:21
we're just going to call it blog and here we are going to link to the blog and the blog is called Prime
6:15:28
jungle right that's that's what we called it in the end it was news and we created another one called Prime jungle
6:15:35
so we're going to add that one because all the blog posts we're going to assign them to Prime jungle so I'm going to click on ADD and the blog can come after
6:15:44
our story no I don't want it under I want it after there we go so if you would do that if you would addit as a
6:15:51
nested menu then here our story will be a drop down that will also open up the blog but we don't want that it's okay
6:15:57
for it to be stand alone just like that okay let's click on Save menu and now
6:16:02
let's go to the homepage and see what it looks looks like so we're just going to refresh our homepage and now you can see
6:16:09
a lot more links here only it did skip a line it did go to the next one so that
6:16:14
means that I am going to have to move one of them and I didn't add the shipping policy cuz I will add it to the
6:16:20
bottom maybe I will rename track your order to order tracking and let's see if that will
6:16:25
help so order tracking and it didn't really so we are
6:16:34
still going to change one of these I'm going to let go of the home so I'm going
6:16:39
to delete that and I'll still call it track your order now of course you can always
6:16:45
change things around some more like you don't have to have the logo here you can have it here on the left side and these
6:16:50
will just continue to the right but I do like the way that this looks okay so products track your order our story blog
6:16:57
and contact us if you click this it'll take you to the homepage anyway most customers know that so it shouldn't really be an issue and that is pretty PR
6:17:05
much it so we have our header menu right here and let's just make sure that everything works so if we click on products it takes us to the products
6:17:11
page track your order we'll track the order our story tells our little story
6:17:16
The Blog has the blog article that we wrote this featured image came out way way too big so I'm going to have to
6:17:22
change that to another image I will do that and we can completely skip over the featured image if we don't like it at
6:17:28
all but this definitely needs to be resized and I will do that but we do have that blog article here and anyway
6:17:33
yeah this is way too big I'll remove that but anyway this is not the point of the article people are not going to come
6:17:39
in most of them are not going to come in from the blog they're going to come to our blog from Google which is great but
6:17:45
this image is just way too big so let's just fix that right now I'm just going to completely remove
6:17:51
it and what I will do is I'm going to go to an online website like pixels that
6:17:56
gives us free images that we can use and I will search for a better image here so let's search for security and I think
6:18:04
that any of these can do uh maybe a door with a lock this one is good but it's
6:18:11
long I'd rather go for a wide one even though we can always resize the image and edit but here let's keep it simple
6:18:17
so yeah let's just go with this one right here like someone kind of forgot their keys in the door I'm just going to
6:18:22
download this image and I'm going to update the featured image right here okay and we're going to save this
6:18:29
and let's go back to our blog and now it looks much better it's still a huge huge
6:18:34
image image but let's see what it looks like inside the blog article so we got the image right here 12 home securitys
6:18:40
to keep the burglars away I like that the image is in high quality we understand exactly what we're seeing we
6:18:45
can make it a little smaller but it does look like Shopify takes the full image and just Maxes it out when it comes to
6:18:53
the featured image but we got the rest of the text here and this little image of the product that we're showcasing
6:18:59
okay overall looks great so let us continue so we saw that the blog is working well then we've got the contact
6:19:05
us as well which also works we tested it so everything here works the header menu
6:19:11
of our website looks great and remember that you have the link to the 17 track widget to create your order tracking
6:19:16
page all inside the Shopify cheat sheet if you want access to the Shopify cheat sheet with all of the valuable resources
6:19:22
that I'm giving away in this video all you got to do is comment below this video # Shopify let me know what is your
6:19:28
top takeaway what did you learn from this video and I will send you the link to this cheat sheet enjoy that and take
6:19:34
your business to the next level okay so we are done with the header menu now let's finish off with the footer and we
6:19:40
are good to go so the footer menu we're going to go back to Shopify we're going to head back to the navigation menu and
6:19:46
now we are going to do the footer so we're going to click on footer menu and here we've got two things a search and do not sell or share my personal
6:19:53
information this was a page that was created automatically by Shopify so that's fine we'll leave it as is but you
6:19:58
may have noticed that we don't really see that footer menu here on our website so that is because it's not activated in
6:20:04
the theme settings so in order to do that we are going to go to online store SL themes we're going to customize this
6:20:12
theme and we're going to click here on the footer now here we're going to have to add a block and this block is called
6:20:19
menu and now you can see the footer menu so if you were already here and you were kind of wondering why it wasn't working
6:20:26
now you have the answer you have to make sure that you added a menu under the footer which wasn't done for some reason
6:20:33
as a default by this free theme so we can see here that it gave it a title quick links and then we've got the links
6:20:38
here so we understand that this is the footer menu and this is the whole footer section itself so under the footer
6:20:44
section we've got the footer menu and here we're going to start adding those links so first we're going to add then we're going to see what it looks like
6:20:50
and we're going to make any necessary adjustments so let's go back to the Shopify menu under online store we're
6:20:56
going to click on navigation and we're going to click on the footer menu again now that we know that it's visible I'm
6:21:01
going to remove the search so the search is what we're seeing right here and it just doesn't look good like if I show it
6:21:07
to you on the website if I go down here you can see that it says search and if you click on it it opens up another page
6:21:14
for a search that is just not userfriendly you already have a search here on the header which was created
6:21:20
automatically and it doesn't even take it to a different page so here I can search for a I don't know steam spray and it should find that product so it's
6:21:27
friendly to have it up here we don't need it down here especially if it's going to open it in another page so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to
6:21:33
completely remove that so here under search under the footer menu I'm going to just delete it and do not share my
6:21:40
personal information it just comes out really long as you can see right here so I'm just going to shorten that text I'm
6:21:47
going to click on edit and here I'm just going to make it much shorter so personal information my personal
6:21:54
information okay so I'm just going to leave that that's going to be the link and I'm going to leave that to the end
6:22:00
so I'm going to make sure that that's the last one cuz it's the least important one but now let's add the menu item for everything else so we need the
6:22:06
shipping policy and the return policy so first shipping policy and then here it's
6:22:11
a page no actually it's a policy so we're going to click on policies and this is the shipping so we
6:22:17
need privacy refund and terms of service as well okay so here is one of them and
6:22:23
returns and refunds and here it's a policy and it's the refund policy we're
6:22:29
going to click on ADD and it gets pretty easy pretty simple so next we've got terms of service policy terms of service
6:22:38
and we've also got the frequently asked questions so let's add another one frequently uh let's just name it FAQ cuz
6:22:46
we don't want to make the footer menu too long and this one is a page it's not a policy and it's a frequently asked
6:22:52
questions okay so I would add frequently asked questions first my personal information last shipping returns and
6:22:58
refunds terms of policy okay so this is the right way to make the order for this one and let's see what it looks like so
6:23:05
now that we save the menu let's go back let's refresh and here we go so quick links FAQ shipping policy returns and
6:23:12
refunds terms of service and my personal information we can click on them to make sure that it all works that it all looks
6:23:17
good and as we can see right here well looks like we can make some changes here on shipping this text came out way too
6:23:24
small so let's go and change that really quick and that's why it's always always good to check what came out out of what
6:23:31
we are doing so here we're under policy so it's under settings policies shipping policy and it's this
6:23:38
bulleted list right here if I'm not mistaken that came out too small yeah so what I'm going to do is I'm just going
6:23:43
to clear the formatting and let's just save it without
6:23:50
it and to completely clear the formatting I'm just going to put it here on edit pad copy and this is why we
6:23:57
should always always always paste without formatting so paste in match
6:24:03
style and now it should work out let's give it now a bulleted list for these
6:24:08
two options okay now we should be good to go let's just refresh okay and there we go
6:24:14
text is nice and big and we've also got the tracking shipment here where they can click on it and it will take you
6:24:20
check check your order okay great so that's another part of the footer menu then we've got returns and
6:24:26
refunds right here terms of service which I do need to
6:24:32
update the links here to the refund policy and now we have the refund policy
6:24:38
which is right here so now that I have the refund policy link which is prob jungle. storp policyrefund policy I can
6:24:46
go to the terms of service which I left open because of the link that I didn't
6:24:53
have so let's go here and let's search for that again so I'm going to search for the word privacy okay here link to privacy policy
6:25:01
I don't want that to be the anchor Tex so I'm just going to put the link here and that will also be the anchor
6:25:09
text and I'm going to copy that and put it in the rest of the
6:25:16
places so it was link to oh wait my mistake this was the
6:25:22
privacy policy so let's make sure that we're linking to the privacy policy we didn't add that link yet okay
6:25:30
first let's add the privacy policy to our navigation menu and then we'll have the links to
6:25:40
everything so add menu item privacy policy we almost forgot
6:25:46
that one make sure that you got all of your policies as
6:25:55
well that's weird oh here privacy policy add that as well and we can have
6:26:04
that also here at the end that's fine maybe one above the my personal information okay so now we should have
6:26:10
the link to that as well okay so here's the privacy policy
6:26:15
link and let's go back to the editor for the terms and service page so
6:26:22
settings policies terms of service link to refund
6:26:31
policy I'm going to search for wherever it says link to okay so link to refund
6:26:37
policy let's get that link so that's returns and refunds this is the refund policy so here we are just
6:26:44
going to remove this text add our link and make that the anchor text as
6:26:53
well okay now we search for the next link to okay so here it's link to the refund
6:27:02
policy which is where we were at so let's add that here as well and make sure that it also
6:27:09
links okay search for link to again privacy policy this
6:27:15
time so go to navigation menu we got all the updated links right
6:27:25
here so this time it's the privacy policy which is created and generated
6:27:32
and updated automatically by shop so we really don't have to worry about that just make sure that it is in our
6:27:40
menus okay so where was the link to that right
6:27:51
here and yes as I mentioned it's it's not the most fun part of creating our
6:27:56
store but this we have to have all this down and I showed you the easiest and fastest way to get it all done luckily
6:28:04
we do not need huge legal teams and we do not need to have other people who will create these Pages for us because
6:28:10
we can do it all automatically for ourselves and the most part is being generated for us so that just leaves us
6:28:16
some creativity and creating a good blog page and write several blog articles not just the one that I showed you this is
6:28:23
how you can start creating it but you need to go much further than I'm going in this video because I cannot make it
6:28:29
two weeks long it's long enough as it is and that's why I'm trying to teach it to you in the best way possible while
6:28:34
leaving all of the fluffy stuff out and make sure that you have all of the essential things that you'll need just
6:28:39
so that you can really make your first few sales and see exactly what it takes to make your first few sales really
6:28:45
easily once you have all of this basic stuff down and then you can further scale it up and keep working with the
6:28:51
data that you have with the knowledge that you have on how to make sales online and making sure that you have a really goodlook store with the right
6:28:58
products marketing the right way this is the most important things as I talked about the product that you're selling
6:29:03
and how you are marketing it to your audience but you still need to have all the legal Pages you still need to have
6:29:09
all of the policies you still need to have frequently asked questions you need to have all these things just so that
6:29:14
your customers will have all of the information that they need in order to check out and not leave any questions
6:29:20
unanswered so here's how our website looks like so far we've got the announcement bar we've got the logo
6:29:26
we've got the cover image we've got a couple of products we've got the lower banner and we've got the footer menu and
6:29:32
everything else that we're still going to optimize but overall we're starting to get a website that's actually looking
6:29:38
really good and it has all of the relevant information inside including the header menu with tracking your order
6:29:44
so you now know how to implement this tracking field inside your website so that your customers can track inside
6:29:50
without going to external links you have your R story so they can read a little bit about your brand and feel more
6:29:56
personally connected to it you now know how to write a blog page and articles using best practices and being able to
6:30:04
write articles that actually look good sound good have a call to action to your
6:30:09
product and articles that actually have some value in it so that people will actually spend time on this page and the
6:30:15
more time they spend on this page the more Google is going to bring that further up in the Ser or in the search
6:30:21
engine ranking position meaning that they're going to push your position higher and higher on their search engine
6:30:27
as long as your article is relevant they know what it's about you got your focus keyphrase on point and you're writing
6:30:33
about a topic that people actually want to learn more about and you're actually able to give them the information that they are looking for and in this article
6:30:39
we did that with 12 simple home security ideas we also learned how to create the
6:30:45
contact us page and edit it a little bit and we learned how to create the footer menu as well with all of the pages and
6:30:50
policy pages with a frequently asked questions shipping policy returns and refunds terms of service privacy policy
6:30:56
and my personal information everything looks good we don't have any irrelevant line breaks everything is lined up well
6:31:03
everything is linked up well and everything is simply starting to look good so I'm more than excited to take
6:31:09

6:31:57
the next step where we install the best Shopify apps for your store welcome to step number seven where we we are going
6:32:04
to learn about the best Shopify apps that we can install and these apps come absolutely for free so we all need them
6:32:12
in order to engage with our customers increase our average order value and at the end of the day make more sales and
6:32:19
profit Shopify apps are here to help us run our e-commerce stores and if you'll go to the Shopify App Store you'll find
6:32:26
hundreds and hundreds of apps without knowing which is the best one which are
6:32:31
the ones that we actually need to use to to help us in our business and that won't drag us down or make our website
6:32:38
load slower or make it look all spammy and which ones are actually free because
6:32:43
some of these may actually say free but after you install and use it a couple times it kind of shuts down on you and
6:32:48
says hey you know if you want to keep using it you have to pay us some money so again this is going to be split
6:32:54
between paid and free and I'm sure that you know by now that there are more than enough free methods that we can go with
6:32:59
and still succeed with our stores and later as I mentioned you can always rein invest your profits back into your
6:33:04
business but I do not want you to spend too much money right up front especially in places where it's not needed so here
6:33:11
I'm going to recommend five musthave Shopify apps absolutely for free to give
6:33:16
your store the Boost that it deserves so the first one is called judge me and
6:33:21
judge me is a product reviews importer app there are a ton of product review importer apps but this is the best one
6:33:28
and because of that we also integrated them inside the autods system so so if
6:33:33
you open up one of the products on your stores like in this case it's the portable alarm door stopper you can see
6:33:39
right here that it says import reviews with judge.me so it's already built into the system you don't even need to go
6:33:46
outside to the App Store and install the app so again any product that you open like the pet steam brush you can see
6:33:53
right below the title here import reviews with judge.me so let's go ahead and click on that and get started with
6:33:59
the first app so it took me to this page right here to the Shopify App Store you see that they have lots of positive
6:34:05
reviews over 34,000 reviews 5.0 rating free plan available free trial available
6:34:11
and that is definitely what we need to get started and you can get more information over here so grow your
6:34:17
online sales enhance SEO and PPC so they've got all these other extra methods but for us the product reviews
6:34:24
is enough so I clicked on install and that's going to take me to the Shopify login screen so I'm just going to log
6:34:30
into my store and I'm going to confirm and now it's finalizing the connection
6:34:37
between the Shopify app judge.me to my Shopify store so I'm going to go ahead and click on install and let it install
6:34:44
on the background on the back end of my store okay so let's start with the quick setup welcome to judge.me languages
6:34:50
English we are going to install it on the current theme that we have which is our default theme I'm going to go ahead and click on start setup here we need to
6:34:56
enable the app embed it's required for reviews to show properly on your store so we're going to enable that okay and
6:35:02
you see it says right here Jud me activated we're going to go ahead and save and go back to this page now you
6:35:08
can see it says that it's enabled and now we need to install the review widget so we're going to click on that review
6:35:15
widget added so that's great you can see here it's on the product editor page and if we scroll all the way down right now
6:35:21
we're looking at the electric steam spray for our pets and if I scroll down all the way you can see right here that
6:35:27
we have sample reviews okay so the review widget was added to the left side so this is on the product page editor on
6:35:33
Shopify so I'm going to go ahead and click on Save again and going back to the Shopify app install the star ratings
6:35:40
badge so now is the next step we need the star rating so I'm going to click on install and you can see that it was
6:35:46
added right here under product information so this gives you a star rating under your product information
6:35:53
and you can just click on it right here and you can see the star settings which shows the same ratings as you see down
6:35:59
here it'll just take the customer quickly to the product review section so if they click on it it'll take them to
6:36:04
the reviews below and this is a really important thing to have it should go without saying but the reason that we
6:36:10
need to have product reviews is because we want to have testimonials this is one
6:36:15
of the best methods to get customers to actually trust your store trust the brand trust the product that they're
6:36:20
seeing because they see other customers who actually bought it and they like it so as long as we can get customer
6:36:27
reviews on our product pages even if it's coming from a different supplier because we do not have any reviews yet
6:36:33
because we haven't sold this product but I can go to my supplier to my source for example on AliExpress and from there I
6:36:39
can import those reviews that customers left for that same exact product and
6:36:44
simply put those reviews on my store so we're doing it for the same product it's real customer reviews for this real
6:36:51
product only here we're moving it from our supplier website to our website so that we can get that early start and
6:36:57
gain our online Shoppers trust so we are going to definitely have product reviews it's one of the best methods to help our
6:37:04
customers build the trust that they need and convert to becoming customers okay so now that I got the star ratings
6:37:10
installed I'm going to click on save this is of course on the product editor page now we're going to go back to the
6:37:16
Shopify dashboard on the judg me reviews onboarding and we will click continue and now it's set up your branding let's
6:37:22
display and collect reviews using your brand colors choose the color of your review stars and add your logo you can
6:37:28
update this later in the app so here what they're doing is they're helping you create better colors for the reviews
6:37:34
based off of your brand color so they took my logo and that's a very very smart move and now they're going to
6:37:40
change the colors accordingly you can always change that later on and next we've got automatic review requests so
6:37:46
here what the app can do is send emails to my customers after they purchase so if it's a domestic order in other words
6:37:53
if it's anywhere in the United States then I can tell the system I can tell judge. me hey you know after 14 days or
6:37:59
21 days whatever send them an email right a a review request to leave a
6:38:05
review on the product and same for international orders okay so we're going to leave it as is and click on finish
6:38:11
and now we're all done so the first thing that we actually want to do is import an actual review so now that the
6:38:16
app is installed let's go ahead and do that so I clicked on import reviews and here we are going to import it from
6:38:23
AliExpress so in order for that to happen I need to install the AliExpress app because I imported this product from
6:38:30
AliExpress so here we need to enter our Shop's domain
6:38:37
so here they're looking for the myshopify.com which is this one right here which we can get under
6:38:43
domains okay now it's installing the judge me AliExpress reviews now here's the thing even if your supplier isn't
6:38:50
AliExpress or it isn't Amazon or Etsy or woocommerce but you did find the same
6:38:55
exact product there and you would like to use the reviews that you have on those channels you can also do that as
6:39:00
well so it doesn't actually matter who your supplier is the question is can you find or did you find that same product
6:39:06
on one of these websites where they also have positive customer reviews now of
6:39:11
course we don't want to import negative customer reviews and if your product has too many negative reviews maybe you
6:39:16
should kind of see what's wrong about that product and consider moving on to another one okay but that is not our case over here okay so now that I've got
6:39:23
the judge.me AliExpress reviews installed under my Shopify apps I can scroll down right here where it says
6:39:30
import reviews to your products so they see the two products that I have the electric steam spray and the portable door alarm stopper and now what we're
6:39:36
going to do is paste the URL the AliExpress URL so that it can import those reviews onto our product pages so
6:39:43
that is going to be really easy again if it's not your supplier if it's not your Source just go to one of those websites
6:39:48
and search for the product that you're trying to sell and see if you can find it there with positive customer reviews
6:39:54
so here I'm going to click on the buy IDs on those two products so let's start with the portable alarm door stopper
6:39:59
it's going to take us right here to the AliExpress page and on on this page it looks like there are no reviews maybe
6:40:06
there are and it's being hidden but I can definitely do it on a similar listing for the same exact product so
6:40:11
let's go to this one where I see it has a little bit more reviews okay so here we've got nine reviews and let's see how much we have in this one that's sold 78
6:40:21
times this one has four reviews and this one has nine reviews so it doesn't really matter I'm going to try one of
6:40:26
them so I'm going to take the first one I'm going to copy the URL and here is the URL for that now I'm going to click
6:40:32
on import so this is for the portable alarm door stopper and number of reviews to import it doesn't really have 15 but
6:40:38
I'm going to keep that setting anyway and see what it could bring for me so I'm going to click on import reviews and
6:40:43
now the import is in progress so while that is happening let's also put the URL let's enter the URL for the steam brush
6:40:51
hair product as well so let's close down these and open up the AliExpress link for the steam spray brush so I'm going
6:40:58
to click on the buy ID through autods to easily find my supplier's website and
6:41:03
here it is 1,874 reviews this is going to be an easy one there are a lot of good reviews here so I'm just going to
6:41:09
copy the URL go back to the AliExpress reviews on the Shopify App Store and
6:41:14
paste it right here and click on import number of reviews to import 15 is fine
6:41:20
you can always change a number to whatever you want but just for this example I want you to see how it works and what it looks like okay and by now
6:41:26
it should have been done we can click here on imported reviews to see what reviews it imported and if there's any
6:41:32
reviews that you do not want want to keep you can always edit or also delete them okay so in this case it looks like
6:41:37
all the reviews are good and what I like is that it also has the picture reviews and these are really the important ones
6:41:44
these are the ones that are going to do a much better job of convincing your online Shoppers to purchase this product
6:41:50
they can actually see pictures and not just text that someone is writing okay so now that I see that the reviews were
6:41:55
imported I'm not going to remove any because they all seem good even this fourstar over here I'm going to leave it
6:42:00
here because it seems more believable if not everything is 5.0 even though of course you can get 5.0 for thousands and
6:42:06
thousands of ratings but I do want it to look a little bit more believable so now let's go to our website and see what it
6:42:12
looks like so let's head over to Prime jungle. store and I don't know if you guys noticed but the favicon here is
6:42:18
here as well if you remember from the previous couple of lessons where we did the favicon I don't think I showed it to
6:42:23
you guys so it's here okay so let's go to one of these products let's open up both of the products different tabs and
6:42:31
let's see what it looks like okay so the seams spray Brush by the way guys this page is still going to go through a little bit more optimization of course
6:42:37
you will see it but I did want to get everything done as you know and our website is already starting to look
6:42:42
pretty good so now that I scroll down wait first we can see it right here right so you can see 15 reviews I'm
6:42:48
going to click on that and here we can see all of the reviews and we can see three pages of reviews so I really love
6:42:54
this cat brush it gets the hair out it works really well and the water feature is like a mist and of course you got the
6:42:59
images and you can click to move on to the next image so this is is all great wonderful social proof to show that
6:43:06
these products are actually good that people are not only buying them but also enjoying them and they're taking the
6:43:12
time to leave a review and a photo review which is much much better okay so this gives a great great example and
6:43:19
this is my top favorite app that's absolutely for free didn't pay a time to get any of this service and you can get
6:43:26
that from within the autods system so really easy to use you got the product right here click on import reviews with
6:43:33
judge.me install it and import the reviews as I just showed you so that is my number one goto judge.me product
6:43:40
reviews importer we didn't check out the other product but let's check it out now so here's the portable door alarm
6:43:46
stopper and as I scroll down we got the reviews right here IA two versions so
6:43:51
here it is and we can oh this is that variation that I was thinking about uh uploading which I didn't upload in the
6:43:56
end but it's okay I'm still going to go with just that one here is that one okay so we can see the reviews right here
6:44:03
here uh this is that one fourstar review which I have no problem with makes it look like I said more believable and
6:44:08
that's it we already have reviews it's already starting to look good it's starting to look much much better now and that is app number one judge.me
6:44:16
product reviews importer built inside autods the second app that I would like to recommend is an app called ZX this
6:44:22
adds a sticky ad to card and this is especially good for those Shopify websites I don't know how many websites
6:44:29
you guys have seen But there are many websites where it's kind of like a doom scroll all all the way down to the end
6:44:34
and this is something that I did try to avoid on my product pages but I still want to have a sticky out to card what
6:44:40
it does is when your customer is scrolling on the website on your product page and that add to card kind of
6:44:46
disappears because it was on the top of the page then what it does is it adds a sticky ad to card to the bottom of the
6:44:51
page and it always sticks there it stays there the whole time so if your customer is kind of stuck on this Doom scrolling
6:44:57
on your product page which I hope that they're not but if that happens or at any time they could always click on add
6:45:03
to card because it's always there on the bottom of your product page so let's see what it looks like I clicked on the link
6:45:08
inside the cheat sheet of course guys I'm leaving all the links all the tools all the resources and all the knowledge to you guys inside the Shopify Drop
6:45:16
Shipping cheat sheet for access to it just comment right below this video # Shopify let me know what is your top
6:45:22
takeaway from this video what did you learn and I will happily send you this cheat sheet with everything inside okay
6:45:27
so we click on the link and this is zix so I'm going to click on install okay so
6:45:33
the app is installed now we just want to enable it so I'm going to click on enable/disable and just make sure that
6:45:39
it's enabled so here on app and beds okay this opens up the online store settings just like judge.me did so
6:45:46
zurich's here we need to enable the app and we need to click on Save okay great
6:45:51
and that should be that let's go to one of our product pages okay now I start to scroll down here we've got the add to
6:45:57
card but now I continue scrolling and you can see right here the sticky add to card on the bottom so this is great we
6:46:03
got the reviews app for free we got the sticky ad to card for free which is super easy to install and you can see
6:46:09
the product right here you can even choose a different variation and see what variation you're choosing right here so that's great as well and you can
6:46:16
add to card at any time so let me add this to my cart was just added let me just test and make sure that everything
6:46:21
is working I can see the icon right here that it did add it to my cart and here is that variation that I just added so
6:46:27
it's always important to test out that everything works and here we can obviously see that it does Okay so
6:46:33
really easy really simple zorx add to card adds a sticky ad to card to the bottom of your product pages and this is
6:46:40
definitely a must have especially if your online Shopper has a lot of scrolling to do in any case it's always
6:46:46
good to have it especially when you're down here kind of reading to the reviews and you're getting convinced and like
6:46:51
okay I want to try it uh let me just choose a variation right here and add it to my card and done the third Shopify
6:46:57
app is called Shopify inbox and the reason that I'm recommending this is because it opens up a live chat between
6:47:03
you and your Shoppers now there are a few apps that do this most of them are not free and some of them have a
6:47:09
WhatsApp live chat so if you prefer having a WhatsApp live chat you can also
6:47:14
install that as well just search the Shopify app store for WhatsApp live chat K you've got a whole bunch of apps that
6:47:21
do that to but do your homework see which one is actually good just like I did before I added them to my stores and
6:47:26
before I started recommending them to you as well so in my case I'm not going with WhatsApp I'm just going with a
6:47:32
Shopify inbox it's a nice little chat to have so I clicked on the Shopify inbox link from the cheat sheet and it brought
6:47:38
me to the Shopify app store Page I clicked on install and now it's on my Shopify dashboard and here you can see
6:47:44
chat from anywhere View and respond to messages from your desktop or your iPhone iPad or Android device using the
6:47:51
mobile app so here is how you can see the messages even if you're away from your PC which is why I'd rather use this
6:47:57
and not WhatsApp which kind of shows my real phone number which most people might not want to do that especially
6:48:02
when have thousands of customers you don't want thousands of people blowing up your phone okay so now let's just enable the app it's one thing to install
6:48:09
it but as you guys see you also need to activate the apps and also configure some of them okay so online store chat
6:48:15
is off we're going to click on setup chat okay you can see that it opened this chat right here on the bottom right you can choose what you want the colors
6:48:21
to be so the background and the text and the buttons I'm not really going to change that I could maybe make the
6:48:28
buttons more of the brand color but I need to copy the color code for that and see exactly what color code I'm using
6:48:33
there but for now just for demonstration purposes I'm going to leave it as is the chat icon can be a chat bubble or an
6:48:40
email as you see right here changed to an email icon so you can change it to whatever you want maybe a handwave might
6:48:45
be nice let's see what it looks like yeah it's pretty nice but I'm just going to stay with the default chat bubble and
6:48:51
the label what it says down here so it can say chat or contact help support I'm going to change it to live chat I think
6:48:57
that looks better and sounds better than just a regular chat cuz chat could make the online chat proper think well maybe
6:49:03
I'm going to be chatting with a robot but live chat okay I'm probably going to be chatting with a real person here okay the horizontal position so you want to
6:49:10
be on the left or right side and the vertical position as well and the greeting message so this is the message
6:49:15
that they'll see once they click on the live chat and it opens up right here hi messag us with any questions we're happy
6:49:21
to help okay so you can change that right here or write whatever you want I'm going to leave everything on default
6:49:26
because it's good enough so I'm going to click on Save and that's it that's already there so we can see now that
6:49:31
we've got three apps installed here under online store settings and app embed so we've got the online store chat
6:49:38
the Zurich sticky ad to card and the judge.me reviews so again the website is starting to take better form it's
6:49:44
starting to have all of the essential things and all of these wonderful apps are being installed absolutely for free
6:49:50
which I absolutely love now let's go back to Shopify and here under the app you've got chat settings and here you
6:49:57
can do more things like adding instant answers okay so here for example you already have have one that's set by
6:50:03
default so if somebody says track my order then it's automatically going to send this message to them to see your
6:50:09
order status please provide your order details then they're going to provide their order details and you're going to
6:50:14
get that in a message and it'll be easier for you to check that instead of telling them this sentence okay so you
6:50:20
can create more things here like for example I'm going to click on create instant answer and let's write a
6:50:26
frequently Asked question like what is the shipping time now what happens here
6:50:32
is your your customer is going to get these questions preas for them and they can select one of these questions so
6:50:38
when they open up a chat they'll get some pre-selected questions that they can just click on it and it'll ask that so they don't have to write this down
6:50:44
what is the shipping time they'll just see that as an option as a question to ask so let's ask it in a better way how
6:50:50
long will the package arrive and here you can write an automatic answer for
6:50:57
example we ship the products as soon as the order comes in the delivery time is
6:51:06
usually between 1 to 2 weeks in some cases it could arrive earlier in rare
6:51:14
cases there are slight delays and we will notify you in advance don't worry
6:51:23
you're in good hands okay so that's my instant answer and so yeah so when they ask this question when they choose this
6:51:29
question how long will the package arrive then they're going to get this answer from Prime jungle and that's it I'm just going to click on Save right up
6:51:35
here and you can just create as many instant questions as you want and you don't have to create any if you don't
6:51:40
have an idea of what to create but when customers start to send you messages which you can see them all inside your Shopify inbox I'm going to show you that
6:51:47
later but it's here on the dashboard and soon I'm going to show you where you can see all of the questions that your customers are asking you we're going to
6:51:53
create a contact us page and we're going to connect that to our email address and all of that so it's going to be easy to see what questions they're asking us and
6:52:00
when we notice that they're asking repetitive questions when they're there's a question that's kind of repeating itself and we notice the
6:52:05
pattern there we're going to make our lives easier and everybody's lives Easier by adding that as an instant question they'll get an instant answer
6:52:12
and that way you'll have much less customers asking the same questions over and over again so you learn by the data
6:52:17
that you will get and as we scroll down there's also a pre- chat form so if a customer leaves the online store during
6:52:22
a conversation your response will be sent out to the email provided the app can send them a message or an email
6:52:28
telling them something like options you get special email promotions and updates you can up out any time or anything like that so I'm not going to configure that
6:52:34
now just know that it's a nice thing to have and you can also see the available hours here you can set it so as you can
6:52:40
see right here when customers start a conversation on your online store the automated reply they receive is based on the hours you're available so for those
6:52:47
automated replies here you can set the time on when you want those automatic replies to be sent so you can make it
6:52:52
during your working hours or during any other time okay so it's really nice to have this live chat and now that it's
6:52:58
enabled let's kind of see what it looks like on our stores so let's refresh our website let's go to the homepage and
6:53:05
here we go live chat here on the bottom right let's click on that okay very nice so here are the two instant questions
6:53:11
with their answers how long will the package arrive and track my order let's try writing a new message like hey there
6:53:17
testing to see that it works like I said always test out everything make sure
6:53:22
that it works so here they are going to leave their name and email so that they
6:53:27
can go ahead and get started okay and let's go ahead and start the chat okay so you can see that the message got sent
6:53:34
great looks like it works but let's see how we can see the messages that got sent so of course I could install the
6:53:40
app on my mobile phone and I can get notifications there but I actually want to see it on my computer so let me go to
6:53:46
my Shopify dashboard okay and here you can see under the inbox that we have one
6:53:51
message waiting of course the Shopify inbox is that app that we're using right now so I'm going to click on that and here you can see we have one unread
6:53:58
message I'm going to click on view messages and it opened up a nice little chat box and if I click on it I can see
6:54:04
this message hey there testing you see that it works great looks like it works yes it does congratulations I'm going to
6:54:10
send that text back and as you can see you can also add more things like a quick reply so here you can create
6:54:16
macros so that you won't have to write the same messages over and over again so you can click on manage quick replies to
6:54:21
create more quick replies but here you have like greeting hello thanks for reaching out what can I help you with we're happy to check your order status
6:54:28
tell us what you're looking for if they're looking for products or thanks let us know if you need anything else so you can set up those macros as well here
6:54:34
you can create a discount so if you have a discount on your Shopify store you have to first create a discount on
6:54:40
Shopify I can show you guys how to create discounts later and you can also get to it by clicking on manage discounts here and here you can choose
6:54:46
whatever promo that you have set preconfigured on your Shopify settings you can send it to them right here you
6:54:52
can also add a product which well I have to remove my password protection for my online store which I will do once the
6:54:57
store is ready to start selling but if it was removed I can just send them the link to a product right here and you can
6:55:03
add a file a photo or a video so it's a very flexible chat let's just make sure that my customer got the answer and here
6:55:11
it is yes it does congratulations okay great so we've got three Shopify apps installed absolutely for free up until
6:55:17
now the first one is the review importer as we can see right here it Imports the reviews with the images the second one
6:55:24
is a sticky add to card which we can see right here on the bottom and the third one is the Shopify inbox live chat all
6:55:31
of these apps are free all of these apps are great none of them will go to waste all of them will help us make more sales
6:55:37
the fourth Shopify app is called essential this is a frequently bought
6:55:43
together app and it's also an important one to have because this helps you with upselling and cross- selling meaning
6:55:50
okay you see this product that you want to buy just so you know other customers that purchase this product usually buy
6:55:55
it with this and this and that as well and this and this and that are other products that you have on your stores so
6:56:01
I do want to set this up but I haven't imported other related products yet and once I do that I will also be able to
6:56:07
set up this app so for now I'm just going to install it but I will not be able to recommend any other products
6:56:13
because I do not have them on my store yet so once again I'm just going to install it for now and later in this
6:56:18
video when we get to the final optimization before we start marketing which is actually coming pretty soon so
6:56:24
before we get to that I'm going to do one final optimization to the store and I'm going to add more products as well
6:56:30
and we'll also be able to set up up the frequently bought together to recommend those other products that I will be adding so you want to start off by
6:56:37
creating a new offer which we cannot really do yet so right now I'm just going to leave the app right here I'm
6:56:42
not going to enable it yet because there's no reason to but when I do I'm going to show you guys how that works
6:56:48
and what the frequently bought together looks like but at the end of the day it's going to look like this so you've got the product page right here and next
6:56:55
to the add to card you'll also have a frequently bought together and these are other related products that you added to
6:57:00
your store that your customer can see on the product page and quickly click them in to add them to the card as well so
6:57:07
this helps you with cross- selling cross- selling means that you're selling a product but you're able to add more
6:57:13
products to that one product and this way you're increasing your aov or your average order value and this simply
6:57:19
means that you're going to profit more at the end because well obviously the more we sell the more profit we make so
6:57:24
cross selling is always a great thing to do and look if a customer is already going to put their credit card down on
6:57:30
your website you already bought their trust what's another product or two that's going to make them even happier
6:57:36
and make them feel more fulfilled that they found your website and your product page so this is a form of cross sell and
6:57:42
upselling means changing this product saying okay we see that you're interested in this product but might we
6:57:48
consider this one instead a more upgraded version of that model which of course is more expensive which of course
6:57:55
means that we'll be profiting more so I'm not going to do that I will do cross- selling and we're going to do that once we're ready with more products
6:58:02
and the fifth and final app is called Ecom send this is great for multiple reasons especially because it has popups
6:58:09
which of course we do not want to be spamming we don't want to have too many pop-ups but one popup that I do recommend to have is to try to convince
6:58:16
the online Shopper to add their email address to give us their email address and in exchange we're going to give them
6:58:23
a promotion so like I said soon I'm also going to show you promotions for now let's install this app and one of the
6:58:28
things that I like about these popups or one of the pop-ups that I actually you like is called spin the wheel it just
6:58:34
gets people to engage with it and it works people like to spin the wheel they like to get lucky and see if they're
6:58:40
going to win anything that's really really good and all they have to do is give you their email addresses so it's going to be a win-win situation and
6:58:47
another popup that you can do is just tell them hey you know give me your email address and take 10% off your
6:58:52
first order or something like that so for that they're also you know if they came to buy the product anyway they're going to give you their email cuz they
6:58:58
want that extra 10% or 15 or 20% whatever you want to give them them okay so I downloaded and installed Ecom send
6:59:04
popups again it's absolutely free to install and use and now we're going to enable the app in bed you guys are well
6:59:11
well trained by now okay so here it's enabled and now we need to actually set
6:59:16
up what we want from Ecom send so here you can see we've got a few options on our Shopify dashboard under Ecom send
6:59:23
we've got popups okay so here we can create a popup we've also got subscribers so this helps you to see how
6:59:29
many people have subscribed using these methods methods so let's see what popup we can add so I'm going to click on
6:59:35
create popup and here are the two options that I just gave you so one is okay get a special promotion just by
6:59:41
leaving your email address and the second is spin the wheel now again both work spin the wheel does offer a little
6:59:48
bit more work a little bit more thinking because you have to give a few different incentives so one can be 15% like you
6:59:53
can see here one can be 10% but of course you're going to have to actually create these promotions on Shopify which like I said I'll show you how to do one
7:00:00
can be free shipping but you're already going to give them free- shipping and some are just going to say uh almost oh no luck but they can always spin again
7:00:06
so it doesn't really matter and the first is just to get a discount off of their first order so it doesn't matter
7:00:11
which one you decide to go with customers like to engage with both I would say a little bit more on the wheel but to keep things simple for now I'm
7:00:17
just going to go with the current one to just give them a special promotion for leaving their email addresses so this is
7:00:24
what it's going to look like and here we have the settings for that so discount coupon you want to give them a discount
7:00:29
code or no discount whatsoever in this case we are of course going to give them a discount code and here we can give
7:00:36
them percentage off and 10% I'm going to be a little bit more generous and give them 15% just because for me it's well
7:00:43
worth it to get their email addresses and it's worth that 10 15% investment right now because once you have a few
7:00:50
hundred email subscribers a few thousand email subscribers and tens of thousands of email subscribers you are going to
7:00:56
start making sales like crazy because now you have a niched in audience who like your brand they like your store
7:01:03
they like your product and they actually engage with it they gave you their email addresses so that you can send them
7:01:08
special promotions and you can do that by sending them email marketing you can do it for free on Shopify and we're
7:01:13
going to show you that as well when we get to the marketing section you can send your customers email promotions
7:01:19
letting them know hey guys I'm running a promotion on my store right now and what you can get is this and this much
7:01:25
percent off by doing this and that and people are actually going to go through and engage and listen to you of course
7:01:31
not 100% % of your email readers are going to engage in purchase but many of them will because there's a reason that
7:01:37
they gave you their email addresses they are interested and they want to know more and even if they just give you
7:01:42
their email for the discount that's also completely fine in any case once you have a lot of email addresses email
7:01:47
marketing is going to work and that's going to be a free marketing method because once you have the customers email they are completely yours and
7:01:54
think about it also this way there are a lot of marketplaces that you can sell on that's not Shopify like eBay Facebook
7:02:01
Marketplace Amazon Etsy and so forth but in those marketplaces you'll never get
7:02:06
the customer email addresses no matter how many sales you make how much revenue in profit the platform owner Facebook
7:02:13
Mark Zuckerberg or any other Marketplace Jeff bezel they are going to keep your
7:02:18
customers email addresses or their marketing departments will they'll never share it with you because the customers
7:02:24
they want them to stay their customers they want to sell them the email promotions and this is a well worth
7:02:30
investment even if it cost you that 15% in the beginning I'm more than happy to invest into my business to help it grow
7:02:37
and one of the best ways to do that is to own my customers by getting their email addresses okay I've said enough so
7:02:44
we're going to give them 15% which is a great great deal and as I continues to scroll down we can see a sticky discount
7:02:50
bar display a sticky discount bar at the top of your website after a successful subscription I don't think it's
7:02:57
necessary to show it because if they already subscribe hey they're already mine I'm not going to start doing sticky
7:03:02
stuff and start spamming them with stuff even if it's the promo code they already have it in their email no need to show it anywhere else and the next one is
7:03:08
sidebar widget display a sidebar widget if the customer declines to popup without subscribing we're not going to do that as well if they didn't want to
7:03:14
subscribe leave them alone we still want them to purchase the product and if you keep telling them hey I know you don't want to do it but maybe you want to do
7:03:20
it anyway that's kind of going to annoy them and you may lose them so we're not going to do that and there are other
7:03:25
options like what devices do you want to do it on on desktop mobile or all devices we're going to keep it on all
7:03:31
and when show on a timer immediately I would wait a few seconds before giving them the popup so let's say the page
7:03:37
loads right the website the product page loads and only let's give them 5 seconds
7:03:42
and then show them the popup you can also show it after they scroll so they enter the website then once they start to scroll you'll give them the popup or
7:03:49
if they try to exit the page I'm not going to wait that long I think 5 seconds is great and frequency so how
7:03:55
often do you want someone to see this popup so as long as of course they have not subscribed so every time anyone one
7:04:01
visits or a limit frequency so you want to show a specific number of times per day and all the other times per day it's
7:04:08
not going to show there's no reason to do that I do want everybody to see it so every time anyone visits they will see
7:04:14
the popup only once page rules so here display the popup based on your set rules I'm going to just put show on any
7:04:20
page I don't care if they're on this product page or on the homepage after 5 Seconds give them the popup and that's it location rules in any country no
7:04:28
problem with that and schedule rules show it at all times s there is no specific hours and that is good enough
7:04:34
for me and last but not least you can remove the powered by Ecom s which you see down here and you're probably
7:04:40
thinking they're probably going to take money for it but you can see that it says down here contact us to remove Ecom
7:04:46
s branding for free but you do have to contact them and in my opinion they're probably going to ask you to leave a
7:04:52
review for their app I'm not again I'm I'm just assuming I have no idea I haven't contacted them and I'm sure that
7:04:57
I'm doing them a great deal by recommending their app and as you guys know I'm not affiliated with them but um
7:05:03
yeah you can contact them if this thing kind of bothers you I have no problem with it so I'm done I'm going to click
7:05:08
on Save and last but not least before I leave you can see that here you do not have to create a promotion code in this
7:05:14
case it is autogenerating a unique and non-reusable code for each subscription so unlike other apps which ask you to
7:05:21
create a promo code this app is going to create a unique code for anyone who
7:05:26
subscribes and it's going to give them 15% off of your product price and that's it they're going to have a uni code
7:05:32
which they can use and you won't have to create one yourself okay so that is app number five Ecom send for popups and to
7:05:39
help us with email marketing let's just see how it works and to make sure that it works so back to our website let's
7:05:46
just open up the home page by clicking on our logo close down the chat we should wait around 5 seconds so let's
7:05:52
see if it works maybe not let's make sure we enabled
7:05:58
it oh it wasn't it wasn't published my bad okay so create a pop-up we did we didn't publish it yet I guess I missed
7:06:04
that part I get to excit it sometimes when I talk to you guys so our last and final step is to click here unpublish
7:06:10
your popup so again we're here on the Shopify dashboard on the left side under apps Ecom send popups we enable the app
7:06:16
in bed that's the first thing that we do with every app then we created the popup here and now we're going to publish by clicking on publish and publish and here
7:06:24
we have the opt-in popup so we are just going to click here enable that toggle right there and this is the name of the
7:06:30
popup of course you can change it I just left the default by calling it opt-in popup and now it's enabled so let's go
7:06:36
to our website refresh any page wait 5 seconds for the
7:06:42
counter and there we go get 10% off your order sign up and unlock your instant discount of course you can change the
7:06:48
text and customize whatever you need for me it's good enough and here is where they're going to leave their email address click on claim discount and you
7:06:55
got your first email subscriber again let's make sure that everything works so I'm going to write down my email address
7:07:00
click on claim discount and here I got my promo code we can also check to see that that works so I did notice that it
7:07:07
says that it's going to give 10% and not 15% and that's because that I forgot to update the content I was moving a little
7:07:12
bit too quick so let's go back to Ecom send popups on the uh Shopify apps you can just go to the Shopify dashboard and
7:07:18
search for the app right here and you will find it and we're going to click on this button right here so that we could
7:07:23
create a new popup because that one will be simply can edit it so we're going to create a new one and it's going to be
7:07:29
another one of these opt-in popups and we're going to call this popup to okay so again uh we're going to give them 15%
7:07:36
off so the value is 15% but the text still hasn't change yet everything else is going to stay the same uh but if you
7:07:42
guys want to see what the uh sideb in the sticky looks like I can just click right here so this will leave a sticky
7:07:48
on top which I don't really like it and this is a sidebar widget if they didn't subscribe but again it it's not needed
7:07:53
you can add it if you want if they decided not to add it here they most likely won't add it here as well okay so you can click on where it says content
7:08:00
over here this is where you can actually change the text so here get 10% off your order so here let's write claim 10% off
7:08:09
your first order so it'll make them feel like they have to you know put in their first order and yeah let's capitalize
7:08:16
the first letter of each word looks a little bit better okay so enter your email to instantly unlock your discount
7:08:24
okay I like how that sounds uh we only need email address we don't need their names it's not a must we got the primary
7:08:30
button which is claim discount and the second one which is no thanks we can leave that as well and we've got the
7:08:36
text right here you're siging up to receive communication via email and you can unsubscribe at any time uh once they
7:08:42
got their discount then we're going to say 15% discount unlocked thanks for subscribing copy your discount code and
7:08:48
apply it to your order okay and that's it sticky discount bar we're not going to use any of those and error text it's
7:08:56
just going to send them whatever they need to do okay so we're going to click on Save and this is the second one so we
7:09:01
want to publish this one instead of the first one and make sure that it's good so let's go ahead and do that now so
7:09:08
we've got pop-up two right here so we're going to disable the first one that we created and we're going to enable this
7:09:16
new one that we just created right now and let's go see what it looks like so now we edited the text and it should
7:09:22
look better wait this is the older one let's refresh once again I wrote 10% and
7:09:28
not 15% okay so now it's claim 15% let's go back so here we got the popups that
7:09:34
we created so far and I'm only going to enable this one right here uh let me just make sure that we got the timer on
7:09:41
I think I forgot that as well so there's guys there's a lot of going back and forth and making sure here we go after 5
7:09:47
seconds and just making sure that everything works that's why it's always always good to test test test everything
7:09:53
that you do test it make sure that it works okay so I refreshed let's wait 5 Seconds actually it won't give it to me
7:09:59
because it already gave me the pop up and it doesn't want to spam it to me let's try to close down and open up the
7:10:05
store again hopefully it'll see me as a different session yep there we go claim 15% off your first order enter your
7:10:11
email and instantly unlock your discount and we are going to test to make sure that it works claim discount and we got
7:10:16
it right here okay great and let's see how we can actually see that people are subscribing so let's go back to the app
7:10:22
on Shopify okay and we can see right here so I subscrib twice one to each popup so we can see the pop-up views
7:10:29
here we can see a total amount of subscribers and conversion rate which is great I hope that it will stay this well
7:10:35
most likely it won't but that's a pretty good conversion rate for email addresses and yeah let's see who is actually
7:10:41
subscribing so we're going to click here on subscribers and you can see myself twice I subscribed with my email you can
7:10:48
see what popup they subscribed with and that's pretty much it again easy way and
7:10:54
a free way to get lots and lots of email addresses so use Ecom send absolutely
7:11:00
free to use you can even you spin the wheel I might consider doing that maybe before we uh actually I don't know yet I
7:11:06
really like both methods one is simple and to the point the other can really spark your customers curiosity and get
7:11:12
them to spin the wheel it's really fun even I as a customer when I enter websites I spin the wheel just for the heck of it even if I'm not going to buy
7:11:19
anything or leave my email address but anyway that's just the way that it works and these are the top five Shopify apps
7:11:26
so we've got judge.me which Imports our customers reviews as we we can see on
7:11:31
every product page we click on it and we can see all the reviews with the images and with all of the customers reviews
7:11:38
the second is a sticky add to cart as we can see on the bottom of the website so even when there is no add to cart showing on our product page we will be
7:11:45
able to see it right here the third is the live chat right here so you can open up a live chat or your online Shoppers
7:11:52
can open up a live chat and chat with you instantly even when you're away from your computer you can get notifications
7:11:57
on your mobile phone whether you have an Android or iOS just download their app the fourth is essential for frequently
7:12:04
bought together which I will show you once I have more products on my website and we can add more products that are
7:12:09
frequently bought together with our main products that we're trying to sell and the fifth is Ecom send which shows
7:12:16
popups and gives your customers discounts for providing their email addresses whether a regular pop-up like
7:12:21
this or a spin the wheel both of which work really really great all of these apps once again are absolutely free to
7:12:28
use and it's more than enough to get started so now you have our list and remember that the first one the product
7:12:34
review Imports which is I think the most important app out of all of these even though there's no reason not to have all
7:12:40
of them but for the judge.me you already have that inside autods so on autods
7:12:45
under your product you can see import reviews with judge.me and it'll just make it much much easier for you so go
7:12:51
ahead and start installing these apps and I'll see you in the next lesson where we finally begin marketing the
7:12:57
products that I ordered that got delivered that I'm about to to start selling and you guys can see every step
7:13:04
of the way and what the results are going to be I can't wait I'll see you in the next one welcome to step number
7:13:10
eight where we will finally start to Market our products so before we start
7:13:16
to Market I'm going to split this into two different sections the first is editing the videos and the second is to
7:13:23
actually post it somewhere on our social media account so that we can get people to see our products see our videos go to
7:13:29
our product page check out and purchase so this part is very very crucial to the
7:13:35
success of our stores of our brand of our business just as important as it was to choose the right products so when we
7:13:41
did our product research we chose what products we want to sell and now it's time to show those products to our audiences and if we don't show it in the
7:13:48
right way and we don't show it to the right audiences everything else will pretty much go to waste so everything
7:13:54
that we did until now getting all the technical stuff ready making sure that our payments are set up setting up our
7:13:59
homepage and up imizing our product pages and everything else led us to this moment where we can finally edit our
7:14:06
videos and Market them get them to our Target audiences and then we will start to make some sales so let's go ahead and
7:14:14
get this started we will move over to the cheat sheet where we can see that we are on step number eight and we're going
7:14:20
to go over both free and paid methods so the first thing that you want to do is create organic short form video content
7:14:28
which we will be posting on Tik Tok Instagram reals YouTube shorts and so forth the required budget for creating
7:14:35
organic short form video content is to just purchase the product because we need to create videos on the product in
7:14:42
order to do that we're going to have to purchase it now there are a few ways to go around this you can also go with
7:14:47
videos that are already out there either on your suppliers websites or by taking videos from other sellers however I do
7:14:53
not recommend copying and pasting the same video oneon-one because somebody already created that for themselves and
7:15:00
a lot of people have already seen that video so you do want to still be able to edit it and make it your own and I'm
7:15:06
going to be doing a combination of both here and if you do not want to create the videos if you do not want to edit
7:15:12
the videos by yourself I'm going to show you other methods on how to get that done so the required budget for the
7:15:17
organic short form video content is to purchase the product and the free part is that you can publish as many organic
7:15:23
videos as you want to test and find your winning video then you can double down on that winning video that you tested
7:15:29
organically you can put a budget on it on paperclick PPC ads which I will also
7:15:35
show you how to do and that way you are going to show it to more and more people who still haven't seen it and you
7:15:41
already have that winning video copy so you know what's going to resonate with your audience another way to Market your
7:15:47
store organically is to create a blog page and publish blog articles which I showed you to do a couple steps back
7:15:53
when we were doing the pages blog and navigation menu so if you skip to this part or if you skip that part go back to
7:15:58
step number six and learn how to create blog articles how to generate wonderful
7:16:04
blog articles for your Shopify website and that way you're going to get a lot of people to see your product because
7:16:10
they search for something on Google that was relevant to the blog article that you wrote that provided them with value and from there they're already on your
7:16:16
website they click on the product they go to the product page and they purchase and the other organic way to get traffic
7:16:22
to your website is by using email marketing so by implementing email marketing you can simply send an email
7:16:29
to hundreds thousands or tens of thousands of people who showed interest on your website and send them email
7:16:35
marketing promotions you can do that through Shopify so you don't even need to have any external tool to do that so
7:16:41
from your Shopify dashboard you're going to click on the marketing section here on the left side then you're going to
7:16:46
click on create campaign here on the top right and you can choose what type of campaign you'd like to make in this case
7:16:52
we are creating an email campaign so here you can create emails to share promotions and updates with customers so
7:16:57
we're going to choose that option you get to send 10,000 free emails per month which is a lot of free emails that you
7:17:04
can send to your customers so here you can choose what template you want to use for your email then you're going to write whatever you want in that email
7:17:11
you have all the options here I'm not going to go through it now because it's very easy to do very straightforward and
7:17:17
well I don't really have an email list at the moment for this website because it's completely brand new but you are
7:17:22
going to do this as you dive deeper into your business and as you start to grow and collect more email addresses
7:17:28
utilizing the methods that I showed you in the prev previous lesson on step number seven where we installed the best
7:17:34
free Shopify apps on our website and one of those was Ecom send for popups and
7:17:40
email marketing and in Ecom send we were able to create a popup for our Shopify website which will collect the customers
7:17:47
email 5 seconds after they land on our website in exchange for a promotion code
7:17:52
and that app is also creating that promotion code so it's all being automated for us and we're getting all of that completely for free so that is
7:17:59
what's going to get us to our email list and that is another great organic method to be able to promote our products to a
7:18:05
relevant target audience without paying a dime and those customers are going to be yours to keep forever so let's go
7:18:11
ahead and begin organic marketing our first step is to create short form video
7:18:17
content so here what we want to do is create multiple creatives and multiple hooks now the important thing when it
7:18:23
comes to short form video content is to Simply look at what your competitors are doing it can be for the same product it
7:18:29
can be for a similar product it can be for a completely different product but learn from those viral videos what made
7:18:34
it go viral what did they do in the hook in the first few seconds of the video to capture the audience's attention what
7:18:40
did they do later in the middle part of the video in the last part of the video did they use text on screen did they use
7:18:46
text to speech did they use background music what is the length of the video so learn from all of this and try to mimic
7:18:52
something similar when you are creating your video content so we're going to create short form video content by
7:18:58
creating multiple creatives and multiple hooks the hook is really important the first 3 seconds of the video is going to
7:19:04
be the deciding factor if your viewer is actually going to engage with your content engage with your product or not
7:19:10
and you're going to do that by getting examples from successful competitors as we just talked about and I'm going to of course show you everything step by step
7:19:17
while I do it and now it's really easy to find other competitors other sellers
7:19:22
other drop shippers on Tik Tok uh YouTube Instagram and all of the other social media platforms that have short
7:19:28
videos and reals it's really easy to find them and see what products they're selling what videos went viral just like
7:19:35
we did in the product research section in this video so if you search for the hashtags that I gave you it's also
7:19:40
inside the cheat sheet you will be able to find other creators who look like this one right here so he calls himself
7:19:47
cool Gadget official and you can see that he has over 1 million followers and he is doing it completely organically
7:19:55
without running any paid ads I know that because none of these are sponsored these are all organic videos and you can
7:20:01
just see right here this one right here's got 1.7 million views 1.2 million views 2.3 million views and each and
7:20:08
every one of them is a different product so this is what this guy is doing he notices the trends he orders the
7:20:14
products to his house his or her I'm not sure I'm not making any assumptions here but they order the product to their
7:20:20
houses and they simply make videos now whether they're ordering it to their house in making the videos or paying
7:20:26
some influencer to do it that is a whole different story but you can go in any direction that you you want if you have
7:20:31
the budget and you don't have the time send it to influencers and let them make the videos for you if you've got the time or you simply don't want to put so
7:20:37
much of a budget into testing so many products you can just do it yourself so again order the products to your address
7:20:43
shoot videos around the product show what's so good about it what problem helps the audience solve why they need
7:20:48
it and you will be able to make videos like this person right here so every video here is going absolutely viral and
7:20:56
it's all showing a different product so if I just click on this one just as a quick example okay so we can see the
7:21:01
video and if we click on his profile name we will be able to see exactly
7:21:07
where we need to go in order to purchase these products so we're going to click on the link in the bio right here and
7:21:13
that's going to take us to the product pages to purchase these products and that is how he's making his sales
7:21:20
completely organically absolutely wonderful videos another example is this
7:21:25
Tik Tok account right here so this one calls himself Vapor brush and we can see that this is the pet brush that I chose
7:21:30
I have a lot of competitors on this product but I still believe that I can sell it and I will do so in this video
7:21:35
but here you can see how successful they are with their organic videos so you can see thousands and thousands of views and
7:21:42
you can see how they make so many videos and it should be pretty obvious at this point that you don't want to just make
7:21:48
one or two videos you have to keep testing more and more and more until they start to go viral you can see that
7:21:54
in the beginning he only had 400 views and 200 views but he didn't really give up there even with this this one right
7:22:00
here 153 views and 391 views they're not all going to go viral but suddenly
7:22:06
you'll have 11,000 here 12,000 there and then suddenly you start to learn what works you start to understand it and
7:22:13
pretty much every other video starts to go viral and you get a lot of free organic clicks to your website and this
7:22:19
way you do not have to spend money in order to bring traffic to your website because the algorithm is working to your
7:22:24
favor it's going to show it to more people who are similar to those who are engaging with your video meaning you're going to get more relevant audiences
7:22:31
clicking on your video because you learned how to go viral here's another example from another account they call
7:22:37
themselves pet. and this looks to be also a variety
7:22:43
of products one of them is the pet steam brush then we also have this product right here you can see that they're
7:22:49
testing one product a few times and then they jump over to another product so there's a few products being tested here
7:22:55
but they're being tested over and over again and you can just see that some videos go absolutely Ely super viral
7:23:01
some are just okay hanging in there with just a few thousand views but again this is the power of organic marketing one
7:23:09
more quick example this is the other product that I'm going for I know that I've got competitors the competition is
7:23:15
going to be tough but again I also want to prove to you that saturation is not a thing if you just learn how to do the
7:23:21
right type of marketing whether it's organic whether it's paid you can still make sales on products that are selling
7:23:26
well for other sellers so we can see that this account right here selling that door stopper also has a whole bunch
7:23:33
of videos and he keeps trying different copies you can see that he has the same hooks right here but he's changing some
7:23:39
things around whether it's the text whether it's the AI speech or the background music but we can see
7:23:45
different tests on different hooks like this one right here on the first frame you have a text on screen and here you
7:23:51
do not have it and you can just go on and on seeing what these sellers are doing what's working well for them what
7:23:58
hasn't worked what is going viral and then take that success story and Implement that as your best practice now
7:24:05
of course we are not copying and pasting we are not taking their videos and posting it as is you will see exactly
7:24:10
what I'm going to do with these videos but this is where you're going to get your inspiration check out this video
7:24:16
right here 665,000 views as opposed to the one that came next with only 870 so
7:24:22
when you make your first few videos and they do not go viral right from the start keep going keep shooting more
7:24:29
hooks I'm going to do that in this video as well but I want you to learn from this learn from me learn from other
7:24:34
competitors who have great success selling these products and start to create your own success story following
7:24:39
the right steps tools and knowledge so this again is the power of organic marketing this is what I'm going to do
7:24:46
with my products that I'm going to sell and this is what you are going to do as well to test what products are working
7:24:52
make some sales and then move over to paid marketing with the videos that are working really well for you organically
7:24:58
so you can double down and make much much more sales and profit so in order to create the short form video content
7:25:04
we need to actually edit the short videos so I'm going to be doing that and I'm going to show you two software that
7:25:09
can help you do that absolutely for free this software doesn't cost any money at least not for the first one called the
7:25:16
Vinci resolve so this is more of an advanced video editor which can create super professional videos whether long
7:25:23
form or short form what I like about it is that it has everything that we need and it's absolutely free to use it's not
7:25:30
a free trial and then it's going to cost money and it's not really blocking any features from being used in the free
7:25:36
version and the second tool that we're going to use is cap cut it doesn't matter which one you choose to go with
7:25:42
the reason that I want to show you more than one is to show you that there's more than one way of doing things of getting things done even while on a
7:25:49
tight budget so the second one is called cap cut this is both free and paid and
7:25:55
it's very beginner friendly so by free and paid what I mean is you can use the
7:26:00
free version there's enough to get your video done on that and you're not going to get any cap cut watermarks or
7:26:05
anything like that but there's a whole bunch of features that they won't allow you to use unless you have the pro version so in this video I will be
7:26:13
showing you how to use both of these tools how to create videos on them how we're going to create our short videos
7:26:18
on them while keeping it budget friendly so I'm only going to be using the free versions now if you do not want to edit
7:26:24
your own videos as I mentioned there's also another way to go about it and that is to use ugc creat creators that's user
7:26:31
generated content creators so there's a lot of Freelancers who will create these videos for you the only thing that you
7:26:36
need to do is to ship the product to them so that they can create the video on it and I also left a link of course
7:26:42
to that in the Shopify cheat sheet which again is yours to have all you have to do is comment right below this video #
7:26:48
Shopify let me know what is your top takeaway from this video what did you learn from it and I will send you of course this cheat sheet I know that I'm
7:26:54
saying that several times in this video but I don't want you guys to miss it so I think that that reminder is mandatory
7:26:59
okay so what exactly are we going to get from Fiverr so if we click on that link you can see all of these ugc creators so
7:27:06
if you click on that link you can see all of the ugc creators on Fiverr now there is also another way to go about it
7:27:11
if you do not want to purchase the product you can simply use the videos that are already out there whether it's
7:27:17
on your supplier website or other sellers who are selling this product but this way you're probably not going to get the best video you do want to have
7:27:23
your own original copy that at least is my recommendation and you can use your competitor's videos and your supplier
7:27:29
videos and kind of mish mash that around and create a good video with that okay so what are we doing with these ugc
7:27:36
creators so here on Fiverr we can see all of the ugc creators that we can use and some of them start at very cheap
7:27:42
prices and some start at very expensive prices it really depends on the freelancer on how much experience they
7:27:48
have and you can see that the prices really range here so for example Crystal Jordan over here she is top rated she
7:27:55
has over 3,000 orders 5.0 out of 1K Plus reviews and her services start from just
7:28:01
$35 so that's not an expensive price point for starting off and if you click you get more information inside so I can
7:28:08
play her video hey there thanks I can kind of learn about her see what she has to say see her services and I can get
7:28:14
more information inside her page and here is where we can get more information about her Services we can
7:28:20
click here to contact her send her a message we can book a consultation video call and I can see that she's also
7:28:26
highly responsive so she's probably going to answer me pretty quickly so do your diligence on Fiverr and find a good
7:28:32
freelancer to do your video to create your video content there are tons and
7:28:38
tons over here you can see that I've got over 10 pages of Freelancers that I can contact and see exactly what they can do
7:28:44
for our business and the best part about them is most of them have experience especially these that are top rated
7:28:51
these that have lots of reviews but it will again require that budget so if you want to put $100 $200 or even $50 $35 $5
7:29:00
on the side for this you can do that and that is a good shortcut from someone who actually has experience in this but if
7:29:07
you'd like to dive deepen and learn the profession by yourself you can also do that with the free methods that I'm
7:29:12
about to show you so if you want to go for the budget and you want to take the shortcuts go to Fiverr if you want to
7:29:18
learn to do it yourself this is how it's done and after we edit the videos we're going to create accounts on our social
7:29:23
media platforms on Instagram Tik Tok YouTube Facebook and we're going to post
7:29:29
these videos organ organically there while also remembering to add our product page or store URL in the bio of
7:29:36
each social media account or on each social media post so that you know after they watch our videos they'll understand
7:29:41
that okay if I click here I can actually go and see the product page and actually purchase it so after we post the videos
7:29:47
on our social media channels we add the engaging text our engage viewers will click on the call to action and enter
7:29:53
our shop page to purchase the product so that is the organic way to do things and then there's also the paid version which
7:29:59
is running payperclick ads which means I'm going to promote this video and every time someone clicks on it I'm
7:30:05
going to pay Tik Tok or Facebook or whatever service I'm using whatever platform I'm using to Market this
7:30:11
product I'm going to have to pay even if I'm not even getting any sales I'm going to have to pay for those clicks so
7:30:17
before we do that we want to see what videos are going to work well and this is a luxury that we simply didn't used to have back in the day it was all about
7:30:24
marketing our products right from the start so we purchase a whole bunch of products and we don't know what what's
7:30:30
going to work and what isn't so we just shoot a whole bunch of videos we create a whole bunch of hooks and we put it on
7:30:35
paperclick marketing right from the start because there was no organic videos and we would just kind of you
7:30:41
know cross our fingers and hope for the best that these videos are going to hit it off and make a lot of sales otherwise we're going to lose a lot of money and
7:30:48
now we have the solution to that with the power and the magic of short form video content so I'm going to take
7:30:54
advantage of that now starting with the short form video content getting organic videos up seeing what videos work the
7:31:00
best and then we're going to put our budgets into those videos and hopefully get much more sales and be in the huge
7:31:06
huge profit zone so the two softwares that I talked about is the Venture resolved and cap cut you have links to
7:31:11
them inside the Shopify cheat sheet so you can download it by clicking on the links and I already did that so here is
7:31:18
what cap cut looks like and here is what the Venture resolve looks like from the outside point of view it looks pretty
7:31:23
much the same but of course they've all got their own features and benefits so let's start by importing our product so
7:31:30
we're creating a blank project as soon as we launch and install the software and we are going to start importing the
7:31:36
media that we have so I already recorded videos on the products as you can see
7:31:42
right here and I also took some images to replace the regular ones from our
7:31:47
suppliers that I have on my website so I'm going to replace those as well soon so I took some videos uh I got inspired
7:31:54
by some of the videos that other competitors did however I was not able to do it exactly when by one I don't
7:32:00
know where they were able to get all this cat hair as you can see right here and to be honest my cats were a little bit startled in the beginning from this
7:32:07
uh product let's see what's going to come out out of everything that we're seeing here but you can see that these videos are the ones that went super
7:32:13
viral like this one right here with 1.7 million views so they're um showing you know how
7:32:20
to make it work and why water like how water makes their fur get stuck what
7:32:25
they did right here was obviously fake that fur was not a part of that cat but I was not able to get a fake fur and
7:32:32
maybe that's something that could have been a good idea and the way that they were able to get so much fur on this brush I was not able to get that much
7:32:38
but again I'm kind of rushed on time so I'm trying to do things as fast as possible I know that you guys are going to put more time into it but I did get
7:32:45
some ideas on how to create these videos from watching what my competitors are doing so here on cap cut I'm going to
7:32:52
click on this import button right here and I'm going to import the videos so I created a folder called video ads and I
7:32:59
put the media in its respectful places so I've got videos inside pet team brush and also under alarm door stopper uh on
7:33:06
cap cut I'll do the pet steam brush and on the vinty resolve I'll do the alarm door stopper so let me just import all
7:33:13
my media that I have from the pet steam Brush by the way I use chat GPT to also
7:33:19
rename this product so I wrote a quick prompt renamed this product to make it unique generate 10 unique names that
7:33:25
others might not use for it here's the product 3in1 electric steam spray brush which is the title that they came up
7:33:31
with for the product but I do want it to be more unique so that if you search for it on Tik Tok or on Google whatever you
7:33:36
won't find so many competitors that have this product so I already got 10 unique names and you can see the list right
7:33:43
here I do like ferus Pro so it's you know fur it's it's the animals fur mist
7:33:49
is like the Steam and pro always kind of sounds good the only thing is we already
7:33:55
called our first product the alarm we called that alert Guard Pro Pro so we're
7:34:00
not going to call both of these products Pro so I'm going to mix it in so I was looking for another mix another word to
7:34:06
mix in there and after going through this list since it is a three in one because it Grooms it removes hair and it
7:34:13
also massages we've got this word right here Trio so I'm going to put those two together I'm going to call it firmest
7:34:19
Trio what do you guys think about that name so let's go with that I just wanted to update you guys on a new name that I
7:34:25
will create for that product and how you can also think of it for yourself okay so I have all of these videos and they
7:34:32
were imported not to the timeline yet so here we've got the timeline and here we got the media that we imported and this
7:34:38
is the player once we actually have something on the timeline we can preview it from here now I'm going to do the same thing on the Venture resolve for
7:34:45
the alarm product but let's start with this one first so I'm going to take the first video and I'm going to drag it to
7:34:51
the timeline and I'm just going to drop it right here and you can see that it loaded up here on the preview section so
7:34:56
I can click here on preview and kind of see what I did here so I showed the product and now I show myself combing my
7:35:03
cat's hair with it I'm not sure if I'm going to go with this video because the steamer wasn't on so I've got a whole
7:35:09
bunch of videos that I need to kind of mess around with and see which ones I'm going to use okay here I turned it on
7:35:16
yeah so I'm not sure if I'm going to go with that video so here's the whole part where we kind of see everything that we did and we start to formulate together a
7:35:23
video okay so there's that clip I'm going to put that on the side for now and let's see if we can start Maybe with
7:35:29
this one so this one shows me turning on the product here I can add some onscreen text and now I'm brushing his fur this
7:35:36
is one of my cats by the way I have two cats okay so we can also use this let me
7:35:42
just fast forward a bit so I'm just brushing brushing brushing and now you can see the second cat kind of got
7:35:47
curious and it's like hey what is that what are you doing okay so this is a pretty good
7:35:54
example we can definitely use this video to start off with but there was one let me just take another look here it was a
7:36:01
longer one here this one two minutes long this one was actually pretty funny
7:36:07
because at some point my cats got tired of it and they started to kind of uh run
7:36:13
away from it and it was kind of funny so let me show you guys that part so here I'm like brushing the cat's hair and the
7:36:19
other cat's getting curious and this is the part where the cat kind of gets bored of it so I wanted to move on to
7:36:24
the other cat it's like okay I I am not sure about this thing but okay you can pet me a bit it and then at some point
7:36:31
when she noticed the steam she kind of got startled by it and I I just want you
7:36:36
guys to watch this cuz it's kind of funny um I'm not going to add this to the video because it doesn't make the
7:36:42
product it doesn't really justify the use case of the product but it's it was just kind of funny what happened here so
7:36:48
um I hope it'll entertain you guys before I start the editing so she noticed the steam what's that no thank
7:36:55
you I'm out of here so I'm like okay original cat can can we do you nah he
7:37:01
doesn't want it this is Floy by the way and the other cat is Loca he's male and she's female and look
7:37:08
they're just running away like we're in some horror movie right now and nobody wants to get cut from The
7:37:16
Knife and so I'm like okay can I have a foot nope no foot either okay can we go
7:37:23
back to flaky flaky can we try you again nah he's not going to have none of it
7:37:28
nope okay Loca can we just just really quickly for the video come on I got to
7:37:34
sell this product can I have your foot again she's not even going to give me a foot anyway I thought that that was
7:37:40
pretty funny so let's go ahead and start shooting this video I did like how the video started because here I did show
7:37:47
the product so okay there's this product right here you press this button right here and steam comes out so right away
7:37:53
from the hook you need to show the audience what the product is why they need it what it does and you want to do
7:37:59
that as soon as possible you don't want to start with a boring unboxing and you don't want to start with um something
7:38:05
that doesn't show the product or doesn't show it uh being used right away and I also like this video cuz you kind of got the second cat here that's uh becoming
7:38:12
curious so it's kind of showing the uh audience that it does spark the cat's
7:38:17
curiosity or dog whatever you have this is something that animals kind of like and you can kind of see like how it's
7:38:24
like brushing the fur and kind of organizing it and it just looks much
7:38:29
much better with the steam to be honest rather than U you know just being dry and the hair is still kind of all
7:38:36
over the place so yeah so I'm going to start off with this video okay so we're not just going to use one video from
7:38:42
beginning to end add some text and that's it first we need to create some splits we need to create some transitions we need to make sure that
7:38:48
the video is not boring and also not repetitive so the first part that I'm going to leave out is after he kind of
7:38:53
got bored with the product so for now I'm going to make the cut around here
7:38:59
okay so what I'm doing here is I'm just going to take this part from the timeline and I've got this button right
7:39:05
here it's called split so I'm going to click on that and what it did is it kind of split this video into two parts so
7:39:11
the second part I can remove it I can move it somewhere else I can do whatever I want which in this case we don't really need it so I'm just going to
7:39:17
click backspace to delete it so now I got the first part of the video and I'm going to start by adding text and adding
7:39:24
text to speech and adding background music and seeing what other Clips we are going to add here but basically this can
7:39:30
be a standalone clip now usually I wouldn't just have one clip as a standalone I could add another one which
7:39:36
shows other things that I did like for example I showed the two brushes side by
7:39:42
side and how you can kind of take off the fur but I didn't have that much fur to be honest so this could get the audience to think oh that's it that's
7:39:48
all the fur he was able to get off there and again if I would have had more time to put into this video I would have
7:39:54
bought some fake fur or I would have uh brushed my uh cats for days and days and
7:40:00
just kind of collect the fur because you can't really get that much fur from one try uh so those videos were a little bit
7:40:05
exaggerating but they were able to get the fur and let's see some other cuts that I did here so there's another video
7:40:11
where I was brushing Loca the small cat which is this video right here so here
7:40:18
I'm kind of petting her making her comfortable and but then as soon as I brought this out and I steamed it
7:40:26
up she wasn't really with me there so I can't really use those but there was a
7:40:32
video where I was able to get her to get comfortable with it which I think is this
7:40:45
one now the steam isn't on here but I could use this one in another video so I
7:40:50
couldn't really get the the small one I couldn't really get Loca to uh enjoy this product so we are going to have to
7:40:56
go with what we have okay so the first video is going to be from this clip which shows the product uh in action it
7:41:02
showcases its use case pretty well and I'm going to end off with this little clip right here and I could leave Loca
7:41:08
for another video or maybe add her part to a second part of this video so our
7:41:14
regular video is around let's see almost a minute long which is long enough for a video so I might use Loca for another
7:41:22
video and maybe mix in floky and Loca in the second video because Loca has a
7:41:27
really short video okay so I'm just going to leave I'm just going to highlight these clips and remove them from the timeline so whatever we have in
7:41:34
the timeline is what's going to be saved in the end so these are the clips that we're going to use for the first video I know it's not much but we're going to
7:41:40
make it very basic and we're going to um try other methods in the other videos but I want you guys to have a clear
7:41:46
explanation on how to add all of the needed elements for your videos also of course the thought process behind it to
7:41:52
keep the video interesting informative and show everything that our audience need to see as well as the pain points
7:41:58
the problem that we're helping solve how the product works and keeping the hook very interesting okay so the first thing
7:42:03
that we need to do is add text and what I'm going to do here is I'm going to add text that will kind of spark my
7:42:09
audience's curiosity to get them to want to see more of the video the more watch
7:42:14
time that they have the higher the chance that the algorithm is going to work to our favor and show this video to
7:42:20
more and more audiences so we do want to keep them really hooked in the beginning of the video and so what I'm going to do
7:42:25
here is I'm going to add text so I'm going to click right up here on text and here you can see there's a whole bunch
7:42:30
of readymade text for us to use lots of different templates from capcut which is very convenient but you see everywhere
7:42:37
where it says Pro we need the pro version of cap cut to use this so like I said I am showing you guys the free way
7:42:43
to do things so I'm not going to show anything that has to do with Pro same thing as when I created my Logos and
7:42:50
images on canva and I just know that the free versions are more than enough to get your sales and again like I
7:42:55
mentioned you can always reinvest your profits back into the business to make everything look look better but first
7:43:00
sell the right product know how to Target your audiences know how to create great videos for your products and
7:43:06
everything else is a bonus so if you click here on join Pro you're going to have to sign in go through their pricing
7:43:13
see what matches your budget I'm not going to do it here because it's not relevant for the video and we do not need that in order to make sales so what
7:43:19
I'm going to do is I'm going to take one of these options and if you just click on it you can see what it will look like so I can click here I can see what this
7:43:26
will look like what this will look like and I don't want anything too too fancy
7:43:31
okay you don't want anything that's hard to read anything that simply does not really look good with the video anything
7:43:37
that blends in with the background is also not good so you have a whole bunch of options here and you can also just
7:43:43
see what the competitors did so again here you do want to have text right in
7:43:49
the first second of the video so that even when they're scrolling here you can read something right and it's more
7:43:54
interesting than those where you can't read anything because in many cases you won't even understand what the video is
7:44:00
about so it's always good to have text in the first second so here it's very clear text that's just using a drop
7:44:07
shadow under a white text here we've got black text with a white background here we have a white text with a black
7:44:14
outline so all kinds of different text works here as long as it's clear and
7:44:19
easy to read so we're not going to go for anything too fancy too colorful I'm going to go with something that's fairly
7:44:25
basic and that's very easy to read and understand this is nice but it has also an outline and a glow it's a little bit
7:44:31
too much I want something that's a little bit simpler but also super easy to read this is not very easy to read so
7:44:38
we are going to continue with other options this one is pretty good this also resembles one of the examples that
7:44:44
we saw here it resembles this video here that made almost 50,000 views so it's the white text with the black outline
7:44:51
which is this one right here I'm going to go with this it's good enough so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this text I'm going to drag it onto the
7:44:58
timeline to the beginning of the timeline because I do want the text to be shown right from the beginning next
7:45:03
I'm going to zoom in on the timeline so that I could make proper adjustments so here I've got the zooming option and I'm
7:45:09
going to drag it to the right you can see that the timeline the the files on it are getting bigger so here I'm going
7:45:16
to zoom in a bit and I can see exactly what's going to happen here is the 5-second mark the 10sec mark so it makes
7:45:22
it easier to make cuts and make adjustments and now we need to actually write what we want on the text so the
7:45:27
first message message that I want to get across here is I can't believe no one told me about this okay let's start with
7:45:33
something like that so what what I'm doing here is I'm trying to get the audience to be like nobody told you
7:45:39
about what and while they're seeing a product that's kind of also sparking their curiosity and what I'm doing here
7:45:44
is I'm going to try to get them to stay for the next few seconds so I can't believe nobody told me about this okay
7:45:51
hopefully it's not too much text and it'll be readable from anyone here because you can see that you can't have
7:45:58
too much text on screen otherwise it's going to be too small and it's going to be hard to read so my text is actually
7:46:05
pretty long and we're going to have to see how it comes out in the end to understand if it was a good idea or not
7:46:11
but I do like the way that it makes you kind of curious to understand what this is about I can also make another line
7:46:17
break and then we'll have three lines here I can't believe nobody told me about this and now I can make the text
7:46:23
bigger okay I don't want to get too close to the edges because sometimes it's going to just get cut off and I
7:46:29
don't want to go too far up top and too much on the bottom because Tik Tok usually adds um uh text or elements
7:46:34
there and things like that so I'm going to put it not exactly in the middle but let's say more maybe more here on the
7:46:39
top somewhere around here I can't believe nobody told me about this now let's see how long it's going to play
7:46:45
for but before that I just want to add one more thing which is text to speech now I'm not going to do it in every video but I am going to test it in this
7:46:51
one so here on the top right you can see it says text to speech in order to see that you have to make sure that you are
7:46:57
clicking on the text section on the timeline cuz if I click on the video I'll see different options here on the
7:47:02
top right and if I click back on the text I can see the options for the text so I'm going to click now on text to
7:47:08
speech and again here you have a lot that are pro that are not included in the free version but that's fine the
7:47:14
free version is more than enough so we're going to click here on English and just look for something that sounds
7:47:20
similar to what your the competitors are using that actually works pretty well so it's usually a male atom Voice or a
7:47:27
female AI voice so we're going to have to click around a few of these and see which ones are very similar so for
7:47:35
example I can click on Julia here you using the text to speech feature using
7:47:40
the textto speech feature choose a voice you like too much of an accent you're using the text to spech you're using the
7:47:47
text to speech feature choose a voice you like I'm going to go with that one so energetic female we're going to go
7:47:53
with energetic female so what I'm going to do is here just click on what you want to use and then click here on
7:47:59
generate speech okay and here you have the generated speech and you want to make sure that the text stays on screen
7:48:06
as long as the audio is still being used so I'm going to make this a little bit longer to make sure that it stays on
7:48:13
screen to make sure that that the text stays on screen for as long as the text to speech and let's see if this does
7:48:19
justification to the video so let's see how the first part came out I can't believe nobody told me about this okay
7:48:28
that's pretty good that resembles short videos that work well for other people so I can't believe nobody told me about
7:48:33
this and right after that we want to talk about what this is right and what this does so what I'm going to do is I'm
7:48:39
going to continue this text to speech and I'm going to keep it relevant all throughout the video I might not need
7:48:45
the video to be 1 minute long let's see how long it is for these other competitors so this competitor here made
7:48:51
a video that's 27 seconds long this was the most viral one this one here is about 31 seconds long so we're looking
7:48:56
at around the half a minute range this one is 55 seconds long which also worked
7:49:02
pretty well how much did he get there 50,000 views which was more than the 30,000 that we saw on these 30 seconds
7:49:07
but these 30 seconds really hit it off at 1.7 million views let's see this one right here 300K this one is 13 seconds
7:49:14
long so very very short and this one here 37k 37 seconds
7:49:20
long so we are seeing the average around half a minute and this one right here 14k 15 seconds long so I'm going to keep
7:49:26
it around 30 40 seconds long that's the length that I should be going for so I will have to cut this video and it's
7:49:32
probably going to be one I'm just rinse and repeating right so this is where the video kind of gets boring where you're just kind of doing the same thing over
7:49:38
and over um even though I do like that the locco was kind of uh there but I will have to make a Cuts so let's so
7:49:46
let's do that part right now before I dive into the rest of the video editing
7:49:51
so I'm going to look for the boring sections which will probably be here so here I'm petting but then you see Loca
7:49:58
which is is cute and then she kind of disappears and here I'm going to make a cut so I'm going to click on the video
7:50:04
on the timeline I'm going to click here on the split button and I'm going to decide when I want the video to return
7:50:09
so now we're going to look at all of the sections that are being removed so it's all of this all of
7:50:16
this and we're going to bring it back to see the other cat again so I'm going to split it again over
7:50:23
here and now the split in the middle is going to be removed okay so now the
7:50:28
timeline Lane merge without that split that we did in the middle so you do a before split after split and you cut whatever is in the middle so now the
7:50:34
video is about 50 seconds long so we still will need to cut it down some more a bit but I want to make sure that the
7:50:41
cut the transition is fine because you can see right here is where the video got cut and I don't want to make it way
7:50:48
way too obvious that it was cut it doesn't need to be super smooth but it needs to make sense so I just want to play the video really quickly to make
7:50:53
sure that the transition is as natural as it could be now it happens yep it's great you can
7:51:01
barely even notice it okay so that looks really good
7:51:07
okay and let's and as we continue it's more petting more petting more petting and here I showed the steam actually
7:51:14
working so I'm going to I want to leave that I want to leave that in the video so I'm going to cut everything that was
7:51:20
before because it was still again super repetitive so I'm going to make a cut before I show the steam so okay I can't
7:51:26
believe nobody told me about this and there's going to be more text and now you're going to see the product you're going to see him being petted I think
7:51:31
I'm going to remove okay after she showed herself again and then she disappeared I'm going
7:51:37
to remove the next part because it's again it's repetitive okay so we removed
7:51:42
it and now let's play the video now it's about 45 seconds long so we could cut
7:51:47
out another part but let's just make sure that everything looks good so we're playing it looks all right this was the
7:51:54
first cut this was the second cut where you actually see the steam great the cuts are actually looking good okay then
7:52:01
it's back to petting him for a bit maybe I could have started with that
7:52:07
where they could see the steam even though they could see it here and then here
7:52:13
again and then here is where he kind of gave up so I'm going to cut the video before he wanted
7:52:19
out here okay I'm going to make another split here
7:52:31
and that's it this part is not really relevant and now we've got about a 35
7:52:37
which is a pretty good length according to our research and that's it so let's just watch the video really quick okay
7:52:43
without all the text I can't believe nobody told me about this except for what we did in the beginning now I need
7:52:49
to add the rest of the text in the video to keep it interesting to keep it informative to keep the the viewer on our side and to make sure that they do
7:52:56
click in the end on the link in the B to purchase the
7:53:05
product so here there's going to be more text more text background music of
7:53:11
course maybe we could cut the second part out I'm not too sure about it and then this shows of course I'm going to
7:53:18
turn off the audio so I realized that there is a background audio which we need to remove so in order to do that we're going to click right here on the
7:53:25
timeline you can see that the video and the uh audio are together so what we're going to do is we're going
7:53:30
to click here on mute track and now it just mutes everything that we have here so there's going to be no more volume
7:53:36
left when we're playing it and now we're going to add our own background music so let's see what background music we are
7:53:41
going to use so to add the background music what we're going to do is right up here we have all of the options that we
7:53:46
can use and we are going to click on audio now this part we do need to choose
7:53:52
something that is good we can't just go with anything that might sound good to us we got to make sure that it actually
7:53:57
fits the video and that everything kind of Blends in together naturally so you can see all the ones that are free it
7:54:03
just says free on it so we are only going to go with the audio that has the free on it you cannot add whatever music
7:54:10
that you want to your videos okay you can add copyrighted music at some point your audio is simply going to be
7:54:15
silenced and your video is not going to be doing as well when everything is silent so what we're going to do is
7:54:20
choose something that is free to use from cap cut but again we do want something that actually makes sense because if I go with this blue skies
7:54:26
here just click on it to preview [Music] it's nice but it's not close to the kind
7:54:33
of music that that we're seeing that we're hearing for these kinds of videos so you can just move one by
7:54:40
one and try to find something that's [Music]
7:54:48
[Applause] relevant this is
7:54:54
[Applause] [Music] good this is good
7:54:59
[Music] yeah we're going to go with this one so I'm going to take it and I'm going to drag and drop it right here now I don't
7:55:06
want it to be too loud I do want the background music to be exactly that I want it to be in the background so what
7:55:12
I am going to do is I'm going to turn down the volume a bit in order to do that you can see that it's right here on the timeline it's called Indie pop
7:55:17
energy first things first is making it as short as the clip otherwise if you export a file like this when you're done
7:55:23
working on it the timeline for the video is going to go up until 37 seconds but the video is going to go black and the
7:55:29
music is going to continue playing until the end of the music timeline so we do want to make it shorter as short as the
7:55:35
video itself so I'm just just kind of dragging the end until the end of the video and if I continue making cuts to
7:55:42
the video I got to make the cut for this as well everything needs to end at the right time at the same time okay so now
7:55:47
we're just going to turn down the volume by clicking on this line that you see over here where the audio is and we're
7:55:52
just going to drag it down a bit and we're going to see how that sounds I want to make sure that that the text to speech is more noticeable than the
7:55:59
background music so now let's play and see what it sounds like I can't believe nobody told me about this okay that's
7:56:07
great the background music is there it's not interfering but it's there and it sounds nice so I'm going to keep that
7:56:13
and what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to work on text for the rest of the video then I'm going to finish it
7:56:18
export it and work on other copies but before I do that I also want to show you how to work with the Vinci resolve as I
7:56:25
promised you have all of the basics to work here on cap cut with the free version and in order to keep everything
7:56:32
that I used actually there's one more thing that I want to show you but in in order to keep everything that we used we're just going to copy and paste the
7:56:38
text and also the text to speech and we're just going to make the necessary adjustments and this way we won't have
7:56:44
to go and pick the font again and pick the voice again we're just going to have to make necessary changes for each one
7:56:49
so here's what I mean by that so here let's click on the text again okay where it says I can't believe nobody told me
7:56:54
about this and I'm going to change the font so I'm going to go back here to basic and here you've got the font now
7:57:00
you can use whatever font that you like and you also have the preset Styles here so you can choose how you want the text
7:57:05
to look but in my case I'm going to keep it the way that it was which is this white text with a black outline so the
7:57:12
font here you can go again with whatever you want and one thing that I don't really like about cap cut is guys it's
7:57:18
not a native app and it's a Chinese app so you can see that there's a lot of fonts here that are not really relevant
7:57:25
to us and that's it so you you'll also kind of notice it as you're moving
7:57:30
around the uh cap cut application uh some grammar is not really on points it does have all of the elements that we
7:57:36
need but it does also feel a little bit amateur when you compare it to more professional tools like the vinue resolve but again it also makes things
7:57:43
easier because it has shortcuts to everything you already have the text templates and you'll notice it when I compare it to the Venture resolve you'll
7:57:50
easily notice the differences but personally I like to work with both of these software and it really depends on your personality and style so that's why
7:57:56
I want to show you both methods and not just just have you stick to one so the font that I really like is called monserat we already talked about it
7:58:03
before in this video and it's hard to find here but here we go it's called Monster at black and this one needs to
7:58:09
be downloaded so I'm going to click on download and then I'm going to click on it so this is what it looks like
7:58:14
although this one is a little bit fatter than what I'm used to let's continue moving down until we find another type
7:58:20
of monster ad they also don't really have it um in alphabetical order which also makes it not as easy Here regular
7:58:27
monster at there we go this looks better so this textt I I just a lot of people are using it it looks good uh it gets
7:58:33
the job done so this is why I use it and again it's easy to read this is what we need at the end of the day we need good engaging text okay so I also chose my
7:58:40
font if you do not have the monster ad font whether you're using capcut which has an internal downloader which is
7:58:46
comfortable um but on other places uh in other software like the Vinci resolve the font was not there automatically so
7:58:52
you're going to have to download The Monster at fought if you do not have it so just go to Google and search for Monster font download and it will let
7:58:59
you download that font and once you have it downloaded you have to just click on it and it'll install on your computer
7:59:05
and then just restart the software the video editing software and you will be able to choose that font okay so now that we have everything down we just
7:59:11
need to copy and paste and continue this flow until we're done with the video so for example what we're going to do is
7:59:17
this I can't believe nobody told me about this okay now I want to move to
7:59:23
the next section so I'm just going to leave you another half a second to kind of get them to resonate with
7:59:28
about this okay so I made a little bit longer and I want to make
7:59:35
sure let's say around here so the text is going to go a little bit longer than the voice which is fine he told me about
7:59:42
this okay now we're going to move on to the next part so what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy the text so I'm going
7:59:47
to click on contrl C or command C whether using uh Windows or Mac and then we're going to paste it with command V
7:59:54
or control+ V and here you can see the same text so what I'm going to do is I'm going to squeeze it and put it right
8:00:00
next to the previous text and we're just going to edit the text here so we're going to click on this section of text
8:00:06
on this block of text then we're going to go back to the top right and we're going to write the next part so for example it's um I still need to get more
8:00:13
uh inspiration but um calling all fur parents so maybe something about fur pet
8:00:19
ownership want to make grooming a breeze water is so effective let's use steamy brush okay so I can't believe no one
8:00:26
told me about this okay we're going to call it fmst right so we're going to say fmst Trio we're going to get them to
8:00:32
know what this product is called and what it does firmest Trio brushes no before we
8:00:39
give them the name let's leave that for maybe the next one
8:00:46
so a threein one steam brush that Combs
8:00:51
massages and removes going to make the text a little bit smaller so it won't get cut from the sides
8:00:59
okay it's a bit long let's try it out so I got the next piece of text now I'm
8:01:05
going to add the text to speech so in order to do that I can't copy and paste
8:01:10
because this one is assigned to this text over here so what we are going to do is we're going to click on this text box and we're going to click again on
8:01:16
text to speech and we're going to choose the same energetic and we're going to click on generate
8:01:23
speech and we are going to make sure that it starts when that text starts so
8:01:28
we're not going to put it right next to the previous text to speech because the text goes a little bit longer than the
8:01:35
audio so we don't want the next audio to start before the next text piece starts
8:01:40
so we're going to move it a little bit forward and now you can see by that green line that it's aligned with the next text piece and we can move forward
8:01:46
with this so let's see what that sounds like I can't believe nobody told me about this a threein one steam brush
8:01:54
that Combs massages and remove okay great we're going to keep that
8:02:01
we're just going to make the text go as long as the text to speech you may have noticed that the text disappeared before
8:02:08
the audio finished so now we made sure that it's both aligned on the timeline so it will both end at the same time as
8:02:15
such and remove SP great so that is how easy it is to start editing your videos
8:02:21
on cap cut and the shortcuts that we can use to make sure that everything is there on point but we didn't spend way
8:02:26
too much time getting getting it done so I'm going to continue copying this text field and pasting it and adding the text
8:02:32
to speech until I finish with this video and then I'm going to create a few more copies so that I can test out different
8:02:38
copies different hooks different creatives but before that I'm going to show you how to also do it on the Vint
8:02:43
resolve I'm going to get to the same place as we got to right here and then I'm going to do the rest of the editing
8:02:49
which I'm just going to fast forward for you guys cuz I'm not doing anything new there not doing anything that I haven't taught you you just don't really need to
8:02:55
stick around for the next sections because I'm just rinse and repeating what I just taught you so let's move
8:03:00
over to the Vinci resolve and create the first part for the second product so
8:03:06
similar to cap cut in the Vinci resolve we are going to import our media files first things first so we're going to
8:03:11
create a new project then we're going to click on file import and media and here
8:03:18
you're going to import all the media that you have so here we're going to do it on the alarm door stomper or the way that we called it Safeguard Pro or some
8:03:25
alert Guard Pro alert Guard Pro not that it matters here but okay so here we're going to import all of the videos and
8:03:31
then we're going to decide what we're going to do what we're going to use and see if there's anything that maybe we
8:03:37
should also add and one of the things that I like about the Venture resolve is that we can just hover over the video on
8:03:42
the media to see the clip inside so we don't have to drag it to the timeline click on play so it's a little bit
8:03:48
easier to see what each clip has so here I was kind of dressed up as like the burglar right who's saying hey be quiet
8:03:56
I'm about to Rob this place here I'm picking the door lock I open the door and in order for you to avoid that
8:04:03
happening in your house what you want to do is install this alarm door stopper so this is what it looks like and here is
8:04:09
how you install it and you and here you can see that you cannot open the door but as soon as you uninstall it you can
8:04:15
easily open the door now here is the thing I made a huge huge mistake and I'm
8:04:20
going to have to put up with it I ordered the wrong variation on AliExpress and that is I guess what
8:04:27
happens when you are rushed and not focusing so while I did order the right
8:04:32
product I ordered the wrong variation that doesn't have the alarm system inside and I thought that it was
8:04:39
AliExpress's mistake when I first noticed it so I went to see my purchase and I saw that I did order the wrong
8:04:46
variation so the right variation cost about $2 more and I'm very very sad that
8:04:53
I got the variation that does not have the alarm here so I'm going to have to
8:04:59
live with that and make compromises and try to make sure that my audience will not notice that I made this stupid
8:05:06
stupid mistake and I do not have the time to make up for it because I do want to continue moving forward and teaching
8:05:13
you how to do everything but I want you to know the mistakes that I'm making so you will not make the same for yourselves so while I'm editing this
8:05:19
video I will have to add some extra sound effects that there's an alarm going off and hopefully they won't
8:05:25
notice that there's not the black alarm you know know Square inside the place where it should be but it's not really
8:05:31
relevant because when they purchase from my website they are going to purchase the version with the alarm and I will ship out the version with the alarm but
8:05:37
yeah I was kind of sad to see that I ordered the wrong uh variation so I recorded this a few more times um and
8:05:44
just to see which copy I want to go with uh which one I kind of like the most and
8:05:49
let's see what we can make of it before that we are going to see again our competitor so here I'm going to look for
8:05:54
alarm door stopper by the way I'm searching for this on Tik Tok and you can see that of course a lot more people
8:06:00
are um selling this product and you can also use autods the marketplace where I showed you where I found this product
8:06:05
where you can see other ads other videos that people made for these products okay so we can see here that the ones that
8:06:12
went super viral like this one here 75k 31k 2 million right here so they all have text from the first frame they all
8:06:18
show the product from the first frame so that is also what we're going to do so I'm going to make one copy where it
8:06:23
shows first the product and then another copy where it shows first the burglar and we're going to see which Hook is going to work better uh even though
8:06:31
probably this one is going to work better cuz I don't see anyone who acted as a burglar it's just a different creative that I also wanted to add in
8:06:38
there even though here maybe it is kind of showing like a burglar yeah this one is kind of like a burglar that's trying to open the door and then you see this
8:06:44
being done on the other side and that's why they cannot open it although this one does have the alarm um again I'm really sad that I don't have the alarm
8:06:51
version I might cut one of these videos just to kind of show them what it looks like when the alarm goes off and what it
8:06:56
looks like as well as well so yeah that's extra work and that's because I ordered the wrong variation you see this
8:07:02
is what it should look like with that black alarm really sad that I didn't
8:07:07
have it but anyway okay so we know what we're going to do with the copy more or less of course we're going to mess around with it but we are going to keep
8:07:13
it similar to best practices so I'm going to make two copies here and I will start with the one that shows the
8:07:19
product in action so I'm just going to take one of these let's see the difference between this this shows the product installing cannot open the door
8:07:27
uninstalling can't open the door and this one oh it's the same it's the same one
8:07:33
that got imported twice okay so I'm just going to use one of them I can remove one from the timeline to not make it confusing and then there's also this one
8:07:41
that shows me holding the product opening the door showing that it opens
8:07:46
and then installing the product but I think this one is better it's more
8:07:52
zoomed in on the product okay I'm going to start with this one so of course I'm going to take
8:07:58
this one and I'm going to drag it here onto the timeline so you might notice that the timeline here looks a little bit different than how it looked on
8:08:05
capcut so here we still have the timeline and the audio is being separated to another row over here and I
8:08:12
will turn off the audio because they do not really need to hear the sound effects so what I'm going to do here is
8:08:17
I'm going to click here on mute track and now everything here is being muted so there is no audio there is just the
8:08:24
video so that's the first part the second part is making Cuts so so of course we need to make cuts on the
8:08:29
correct sections so here on the bottom of the vinture resolve you can see that here I'm on the edit form but if I move
8:08:35
to the this one here on the left it's called cut I'm going to click on that and now we are cutting sections that we
8:08:40
do not want to have in the video so you can see that the everything here is a lot smoother than it is on cap cut and
8:08:46
it's much easier to um make these adjustments you just need to know where everything is and that this tool is a
8:08:52
little bit more advanced okay on the other hand it doesn't have all the shortcuts all the extra text features
8:08:57
that cap cut has but it will show you how to get them okay so here how do we actually make Cuts so here okay we start
8:09:04
the video right here then you show me installing it right here and then I try to open the
8:09:10
door I can't I uninstall it I open a door and now I'm actually able to open
8:09:15
the door here my daughter kind of was on the other side so let me just cut right before that happen so I'm going to leave
8:09:21
it right here on the timeline and then what I can do is when I'm standing on that same spot where I want to cut I'm
8:09:27
going to to right click right over here and you see the scissors icon right here I'm going to click on that and it
8:09:32
created that cut so you can see it right here this is where that cut was created
8:09:37
and I'm just going to remove that last section cuz I don't need it so I'm just going to click on it and click on backspace and now it has the end is when
8:09:45
I started to open the door I think I could probably go a little bit more let's see let's just drag it out a bit
8:09:51
let it open up until about here yeah that's around the spot where
8:09:56
we cut it okay so we're going to keep the cut there um actually there's no more cuts to to be made here maybe I'll
8:10:02
just kind of fast forward the sections where I'm like screwing it because it's just a little bit boring and repetitive
8:10:08
so let's do that really quick here is where I start to screw so I'm going to make a cut over here because I don't
8:10:14
want everything to be fast forwarded only a certain section so how am I going to highlight that section I'm going to
8:10:19
make a cut over here so right click here make a cut and we're going to make another cut where the fast forwarding
8:10:26
should end so screw screw screw
8:10:32
finished and this is where I check that it's nice and
8:10:37
stable and this is where I can stop the fast forward so around here so again
8:10:43
right click over here and make another cut so this whole cuted section in the middle I'm going to fast forward it so
8:10:50
in order to do that this I'm going to click on that section in the Middle where I have the split before and after so this is the section that I want to
8:10:56
fast forward right click and you're going to click on change speed by the way you have a similar option of course on cap cut only I didn't really need to
8:11:03
uh use it there so here I'm going to turn up the speed so I'm going to click over here and I'm going to drag my mouse
8:11:08
to around 150 and let's see if that is not too fast okay so you can see that this clip
8:11:15
here has 150% so instead of playing at 100% speed it's going to play at 50% more and let's start a little bit before
8:11:21
just to see to make sure that everything works smooth before and after the
8:11:26
effects okay so I'm going to start it right around here okay now it's being fast
8:11:36
forwarded can even make it go a little bit faster so I'm going to click on it again and I'm going to move this to
8:11:41
around 175 okay and go a little bit before the
8:11:49
the change around here and play the video now it starts
8:11:58
yep that's good check check check nice and strong and now we will try to open the
8:12:06
door I could fast forward even more you know what I'm going to fast forward you know what I might fast forward the whole
8:12:14
video 175 it's very easy to understand I think
8:12:20
that it'll be well so what I did is I clicked on both of the clips and you're going to make be making a lot of changes
8:12:25
a lot of compromising when making the videos so now let's play the whole
8:12:32
video yeah I have no problem with the fast forwarding the whole video it's very easy to
8:12:41
understand and it's about 20 seconds
8:12:46
long about 18 19 seconds long which is great it doesn't show the burgler we're
8:12:52
going to be doing a few different uh versions here where the first one only shows the product install cannot open
8:12:57
the door uninstall can open the door that's exactly what it does and I will have to add the alarm sound effect here
8:13:03
when I'm trying to open the door so kind of like the alarm is going off here at this section and then the second part
8:13:10
where I am able to open the door once of course I uninstall it this part is a little bit too short but we are going to
8:13:16
have to see guys we're going to have to see we're going to have to finish the editing see how it came out make another creative make another hook and that's
8:13:22
why I say never stick only with one copy because you'll never know what went wrong if that video didn't end up
8:13:28
working out so I'm going to mess around with this but let me show you how to do the rest of the elements so let's add text so in order to do that we need
8:13:35
another section here that will show me all of those options so first what we're going to do is we're going to get out of
8:13:40
the cutting section and we're going to go back to the editor so I'm going to click here on edit and then we're going to click here on effects now what I want
8:13:48
to do is I want to add a title and the title that we're going to add is called Text Plus because Text Plus allows us to
8:13:54
make all kinds of changes and adjustability to the text so I'm going to take the text plus and I'm going to
8:14:00
drag it to the timeline okay now I need to Simply edit the text now again I'm not going to make it exactly until the
8:14:05
edges until the borders we're going to make it a little bit uh shorter and we're going to start adding the text here as well so in order to edit the
8:14:11
text we have the text editor here on the right side so make sure of course that you're clicking on the text and you'll see all the options here because if I'm
8:14:17
clicking on something else I'm going to see the options for that here on the right side so again click on the text and create a text here so let's work on
8:14:25
the first sentence that we want to use use easy to stop bad person bad grammar but something like that I bought this
8:14:31
for my sister you see that he aligned the text a little bit too high up and that's why you're not really able to see it here that's why I'm saying don't put
8:14:37
it on the edges and put it kind of somewhere on the upper Center or something like that I bought this from
8:14:42
my sister both of these used that sentence Oh it's the same guy actually you see this guy created a few different
8:14:47
versions and they both went viral one got 2.1 million views the other 30k of course there's a big difference between
8:14:53
them this one was only uploaded 6 days ago so you can see that uploaded this about a month ago and it worked well for
8:15:00
him and then what he did was he took another variation for this product and he tried that again as well it's even
8:15:06
around the same place the same setting the same door he learned from the first video that went viral and now just by
8:15:12
uploading a video six days ago he's able to get 2.1 million views I'm probably
8:15:18
going to learn from this guy after my first few attempts but that's how it is you're making your first few attempts you're seeing the results and you learn
8:15:25
how to make it better for the next time and he also didn't make the same mistake as me by purchasing the wrong product
8:15:31
without the alarm variation that's it guys I'm just going to have to put up with it okay so I bought this from my sister when she was traveling alone you
8:15:37
can see that he also fixed the text here and he did align it correctly so you learn from the mistakes of the first video you can still go viral with
8:15:44
mistakes you don't have to be perfect which is what I'm trying to teach you and you learn and make it better for the next one so I'm glad that we were able
8:15:50
to see this perfect example of how to learn from something that you did and make it better for the next time okay so
8:15:56
I bought this from my sister when she was traveling alone I'm not going to use that text by the way here he is again
8:16:01
this one was uploaded one day ago this guy is not stopping he has his success and now he's using both of the products
8:16:07
that he ordered this time he's using both of them simultaneously so this was uploaded one day ago and he's got 5,000
8:16:13
views this guy definitely definitely knows his work and as I continue scrolling down you can see that it's
8:16:19
different sellers oh by the way here's another one from him 20 hours ago 843 views this guy's taking my my viewers
8:16:27
because I wanted to go crazy with this product but he's already doing it look two days ago one day ago a month and a
8:16:33
half ago this guy's been writing on this product for a while now but that is not going to scare us it's just going to
8:16:38
give us more motivation to be Innovative to find more products and to learn more
8:16:44
on how to create great video hooks great video creatives so that our videos will finally start to kick off and make us
8:16:50
the selles that we deserve okay so I'm not going to go with a sister line but I will try to do something around let's
8:16:57
see this one bad guys can't enter your room anymore an effective door stopper so yeah I want something around security
8:17:03
something around burglers and I can see that he's using the same sister sister sister sister sister okay so we're going
8:17:10
to go with something like um an effective door stopper maybe how to stop
8:17:15
bad guys from entering from breaking and entering but then the text is getting too long again so we're going to have to
8:17:21
get creative here okay let's begin okay so I'm going to get inspired by this guy who wrote I bought this from for my
8:17:27
sister when she was traveling alone so it kind of shows that okay let's see how this brother is caring for his sister oh
8:17:33
that's that's nice it's a travel lock and yeah it sounds like a nice gesture because it worked so well for him I'm
8:17:39
going to do something similar only instead of sister I'm going to go with Mom people will also resonate with
8:17:45
helping out their mom with things and I'm just hoping that there's a high chance that lots of people have moms
8:17:51
that travel otherwise it kind of gets irrelevant so I'm going to be using different texts here and and this is the
8:17:57
first hook that I'm going to try I bought this for my mother who was
8:18:03
traveling alone and now of course we need to edit the text make it smaller so in order to do that there is no dragging
8:18:09
and dropping here we are continuing here on the text editing screen on the right side so we're going to move down towards
8:18:14
his size we're going to click and we're going to move a little bit to the left to make it smaller so it's a little bit
8:18:20
too small but it's kind of like what he's doing and it works well for him so we're going to leave it at that we're
8:18:26
going to put it all the way on the top we saw what happens again there's no dragging and dropping on da Vinci it's a professional tool so we're going to do
8:18:33
everything from here okay and next is the font so we're going to click here on font and I'm going to add my beloved
8:18:39
monserat font again if you don't have it just download it from Google restart the software and you will have the font here
8:18:47
and here it is moner at okay now we're going to make the text a little bit smaller okay so that is very very small
8:18:55
I hope it'll still look good in the video video but if it worked for him let's see if it's going to work for us as well and another thing is the text is
8:19:01
very plain right we changed the font but still there is no backdrop there's no uh drop shadow or anything that will make
8:19:07
it really stand out and make it easy to read so what we're going to do next is fix that but first let's just move the
8:19:13
text maybe a little bit further up not too much but I'm going to take this V anchor here and I'm going to move it to
8:19:19
around here so that pretty much makes sense so there's more settings that you can kind of mess around with but there's
8:19:25
really no need for the left and right and this is good enough we can go with this but we still need to make the text
8:19:30
effects and there's a lot more things that you can do here which I'm not going to go over now in this video because the
8:19:36
Venture resolve you can really go down the rabbit hole here and get really really far but for example you can add
8:19:42
Dynamic zoom and this kind of zooms the text as the video uh plays as you can see here it's like getting a little bit
8:19:48
smaller um but I'm not going to use that because it'll kind of make it go uh out of frame and you need to put more work
8:19:54
into that and there's a lot more things you can do you can make each word pop out when you say it and you can add also
8:19:59
text to speech and you can also add your own voice over so there's a lot more that that you can do we're not going to do it here because it's not really
8:20:05
relevant to make the video work but just so you know everything here is pretty much endless the options are endless and
8:20:11
it's all free to use which I think is absolutely great The Venture res thank you very much for giving us such a good
8:20:16
Advanced tool to edit our videos without paying a dime but now let's just keep it
8:20:21
simple but make sure that everything is in place so from the text here we're going to move over to the the shading
8:20:27
column in here there's a few different shading options so there's a white solid fill which is what we're looking at now
8:20:32
there's a red outline over here if you want to see what it looks like you're going to click here on enabled but I don't think it really looks that good
8:20:38
you have more options here once you enable it the one I want to go with is the third option which is called Black
8:20:43
Shadow I'm going to click on enabled and you can see that the text is much more visible now okay again click off click
8:20:50
on so it's much easier to read now and you can again mess around with it a little bit more like here the appearance
8:20:55
I can click on this and it kind of gives it an outer glow I can click on this but it that's just a little bit too dark and
8:21:01
this doesn't really make it look that good so we are going to go with the first option here and again more options
8:21:08
that we don't really need to uh touch at the moment this text here is good enough it's visible and it gets the job done
8:21:14
and people will be able to read it when they are looking at the video even from an outside point of view like what we're
8:21:20
seeing right here okay so we're going to use this and now it's pretty much
8:21:25
similar to what we did on cap cut now the only thing here is when it comes to text to speech that is not an add-on
8:21:33
that is included inside the vinture resolve so if you want to use text to speech there is external software that
8:21:38
can help you with that or you can even export the the video that you made and then import it to cap cut to add text to
8:21:45
speech so you can do all of that but it will make things a little bit more complicated so if text to speech is not
8:21:50
important for you or if you want to use the Vint resolve and try different variations without text to speech or
8:21:56
even with but adding other tools to help you with that just do a quick Google search for adding text to speech on the
8:22:02
Vinci resolve and you'll see all of the options that you have again I do not want to make things complicated so know the ins and outs of every software so
8:22:09
text to speech is not included inside the Vinci resolve and the other thing that's not included is the free
8:22:15
background music so you can click on Sound Library but you can see that it's pretty much empty here I can click here
8:22:21
to download from uh Da Vinci's website and here you're going to have to uh register your information the there's
8:22:26
also another way to go around it and search Google for free music for
8:22:32
commercial use okay and then you'll have these websites like even pixabay which has images but now also has music you
8:22:38
can use them you can download their music and then upload it to uh the VCI resolve and use that music there so
8:22:44
let's do that really quick let's hear some music that we have here and now we're thinking about the
8:22:52
alarm door stopper in mind so we don't want anything boring anything slow
8:23:01
this one is nice but I think we can find something more
8:23:08
matching to
8:23:14
[Music] slow going to click on next
8:23:21
page and if you find yourself searching too much and not finding just choose a category from up here so let's say mood
8:23:28
bright uplifting I don't want relaxing maybe hopeful let's see what we're going
8:23:34
to get from
8:23:40
[Music]
8:23:49
that could be it
8:23:55
[Music] let's go with this one so I'm going to click here on download now it's already
8:24:02
downloaded onto my computer I'm going to go back to Da Vinci and we are going to go back to the media pool and here we
8:24:08
need to import more media so file import media go to where it downloaded and
8:24:14
select it from
8:24:19
there okay and here it is so I'm just going to add it to my timeline and we're going to add it to the beginning of the
8:24:25
timeline okay I can first I want to turn down the volume a bit so by clicking on
8:24:30
it and then here on the right side we got all the options for whatever we're clicking on and we're going to turn down the
8:24:36
[Music] volume maybe around minus 70 let's see how that plays
8:24:43
out nope can't even hear nothing [Music]
8:24:57
although it doesn't really make me feel like somebody's robbing my house it just makes me feel very
8:25:02
[Music] hopeful might have to mess around with
8:25:08
it a [Music] bit maybe choose something else but but
8:25:14
it does also um feel like it fits I do have a few thoughts about this and this
8:25:19
of course is a part of editing your videos choosing the right music choosing the right mood making sure that
8:25:24
everything connects it's all a part of it so it is kind of uplifting it is kind of innovative I'm going to leave it for
8:25:30
now it's only going to be one video copy of course we're going to be making multiple copies so we're going to try some without music some maybe without
8:25:37
text um we'll see but for now I need to make sure that the audio doesn't go on forever after the video stopped so we're
8:25:43
going to go back to the cutting option and you can see that here it's on the end of the video so I'm just going to
8:25:48
make a cut right here and whatever is on the other side of this cut is going to be removed as it is not a part of our
8:25:55
timeline okay now let's go back to the timeline and we can see that everything ends at the same exact moment okay so
8:26:01
the only thing that's left for me to do on the Vinci resolve is to just copy the text and paste it and create more texts
8:26:07
so let's see how long this one goes for 1
8:26:13
second about 5 seconds so let's see if that time makes sense
8:26:19
for the sentence so let's say you're reading it in your mind so let's play the video I bought this for my mother
8:26:24
who was traveling alone here we can stop it already that's long enough I even read it slowly on purpose for slower
8:26:31
readers so I'm going to make that as short as here and here I did not you may have noticed that I did not use the
8:26:37
split to do that you can also do it from the timeline if you just drag the end but you can't make splits in the middle
8:26:43
for that you're going to have to go to the splitting section here at the bottom okay so next I can just take this text
8:26:48
field right here copy and paste it over here and write the next section of text so I bought this from my mother who was
8:26:54
traveling alone now I could see what the other guy did so here for
8:27:00
example let's go to his video this one that went
8:27:15
crazy he didn't change the text and he didn't even use fast forwarding so everything is moving kind of
8:27:22
slow I I just saw how he turned on the alarm and I really hate the fact that I can't uh do that but I will have to play
8:27:28
an alarm uh noise anyway he was using the same uh teex so I'm going to I am going to change it up and make it more
8:27:34
interesting so the second part after I bought this from my mother who was traveling alone she is no longer afraid
8:27:42
of intruders and
8:27:47
burglars and then the next one is if someone tries to enter the door is
8:27:55
locked and and the alarm if someone tries to enter the door is locked and
8:28:00
the alarm will go off okay and I'm going to continue making text okay I'm going to check out
8:28:06
this uh copy and see how it comes out uh we can finish it now but and then I will uh fast forward uh my work for this one
8:28:14
and I'm going to make a few different copies you guys already understand how to get this to work I just want to show you how exporting works so let's just
8:28:20
finish up this video really quick so I do want to finish this video now and show you how that works but I also need
8:28:25
to show them how the alarm works so you understand how to put everything on a timeline how to add texts how to make
8:28:32
cuts on your videos how to add text to speech especially if you're using cap cut so we also know how to use cap cut
8:28:38
we know how to use the Venture resolve I think both of them do a great job especially because these tools are
8:28:44
absolutely free to use cap cut you could go with the pro version if you want but you really don't need to especially not
8:28:50
from the start and they will both do what they came here to do what you are going to use really depends on what you
8:28:57
want to use what you like more I prefer opening them both installing them both
8:29:02
on your computer and trying them both and seeing which one you like the most because really each one has their own
8:29:08
pros and cons okay so once you are done you simply need to export the file and exporting and saving your project is two
8:29:15
different things so for example here on cap cut I can go to file and I'm going
8:29:20
to save my project but that does not save the video it just saves this project so I can always come back and edit the video so here I'm just going to
8:29:27
call this project door alarm one but let's say I'm done with a video
8:29:32
and I'm ready to export it and watch the video but of course before we export our videos which is done in two different
8:29:38
ways on the Vint resolve you're going to go to file and quick export and on cap cut you're just going to go to file
8:29:45
export and I'm going to show you the rest of these options it's very very easy to use let me just finish my video
8:29:50
editing I want to make a few different copies for each product that I made and then I will show you the videos that
8:29:56
came out of it how to export and then we're going to move on to the next section create our social media accounts post these videos and see which videos
8:30:03
are going to be our winners for pay-per-click marketing then I'm going to launch my marketing campaigns on
8:30:08
those videos and show you step by step how to do it so I'm going to continue with the pet team brush through cap cut
8:30:15
I'm going to continue the door alarm stopper through the Venture resolve and let's see the final results
8:30:51
all right so I finished editing a video one for the pet steam brush and the other for the alarm alarm door stopper I
8:30:57
want to show you guys the first video that I made for each so as you know I made one on cap cut right here so cap
8:31:03
cut is for the pet team brush and on the Vint resolve I created the alarm door stopper video and I'm going to make more
8:31:09
videos because as I mentioned we need to have more creatives we need to have multiple creatives and multiple hooks
8:31:15
for each product so that we can really test the market and see which one is going to work so here is the first video
8:31:21
I want to show you my thought process here what I did and what I'm going to do next so you can see everything is pretty
8:31:27
much arranged here on the timeline I'm going to go ahead and click on play and this is cap cut for the pet steam brush
8:31:33
so let's check out the video I can't believe nobody told me about this a 3-in-one steam brush that
8:31:41
Combs massages and removes fur my cats love it and my sister's dog loves it too
8:31:48
it's super gentle healthy and effective just fill in water and you're good to
8:31:54
go give your furry friends the healthy spa treatment they deserve get yours now
8:32:00
with fast shipping and to be honest guys this did not take me that long to make I already
8:32:07
created the first couple sections with you guys and it didn't take me too long to do the rest just a little bit of creatives and the rest is just copying
8:32:14
and pasting the text and then just changing the text and adding the text to speech to every text so one thing that I
8:32:19
did here that I want to talk about is you guys may have noticed that when I was doing the first text to speech there
8:32:26
was a lot of pause between I can't believe to nobody told me to about this
8:32:32
and in order to avoid that pause and to make the speech go smooth so instead of her saying I can't believe nobody told
8:32:40
me about this so now she says it smoothly like this I can't believe nobody told me about this and the way to
8:32:47
do that was to Simply type the text so let me just click on the text field here so you can see it here and what I did
8:32:55
was put the sence together without the line breaks so first you need to put the sentence together then make line breaks
8:33:02
after so you write one sentence without line breaks make it a text to speech and
8:33:07
then after you turn it to text to speech go back to the text and create your line breaks so for instance what I had to do
8:33:13
was keep it like this okay so everything in one line okay even though of course we can't see it on the screen it doesn't
8:33:19
matter we're just doing this for the text to speech then what you're going to do is you're going to click on text to speech when it's a oneliner like this
8:33:26
and you're going to choose that voice that you want to go with so in my example it's the energetic female I add
8:33:32
that voice and then it comes out smooth then I go back to the text and I create the line breaks after we converted the
8:33:39
text to speech so as you saw there's this part I can't believe nobody told me about this a 3in1 steam comb brush and
8:33:44
then my cats love it and my sister's dog loves it too the reason that I added this was for a couple of reasons one is
8:33:51
that I learned that this guy for example that made the alarm door stopper he's always creating this copy I bought this
8:33:57
for my sister I bought this for my sister so maybe people resonate with siblings in the videos as well and I
8:34:02
also added another touch here which is that it's my sister's dog loves it so it's not just my sister's cat so this
8:34:09
way dog lovers will also know that this product is relevant to them then the next sentence was it's super gentle
8:34:14
healthy and effective so of course you want your pets to have a gentle brush you want grooming to be nice and healthy
8:34:20
and effective then how easy it is to use it so just fill in water and you're good to go this was of course all recorded by
8:34:27
me and give your Furry Friends the healthy Spot Treatment they deserve I'm not sure why it says here file is not
8:34:33
accessible but I exported the video and it works fine uh I guess it's just one of cap Cut's uh bugs and then the last
8:34:39
scene get yours now with fast shipping okay so this video came out about 27 seconds long and we can also see the
8:34:46
exported file here so we need to arrange everything under folders make it easy to come back and find your files so it's
8:34:53
under pet team brush and a folder called export so this is the first export that we have and this is the same exact video
8:34:59
so what I did was I simply clicked on file export okay give your file a name
8:35:06
say where you want to export it to leave everything else as is and go ahead and click on export so then with that I got
8:35:13
this file and we can see how it came out I can't believe nobody told me about this a 3 in one steam brush that Combs
8:35:21
massages and removes fur and last thing as you may have noticed this text effect that I added so when the text comes on
8:35:28
screen it kind of like bounces in like this you see that and I Didn't Do It For the first text box because then it
8:35:34
wouldn't show up it kind of Fades in after a second you see like here it's off and then it comes on and I do want
8:35:41
the first frame to show text so that when if people are searching for something on Tik Tok I want them to see
8:35:47
the text on the screen from the first second so that's why I don't have that effect on the first text field but I have it in every one after the way to do
8:35:54
that is click on the text field on cap cut so after you click on your text on a timeline you have the editor on the
8:35:59
right side and you want to click on animation and here you can add whatever animation effect you want you can kind
8:36:05
of hover over it and it should show you what it looks like by clicking on it and seeing how it affects the text or you
8:36:11
can just hover and see what it does okay of course we're not going to go with the pro if we do not have the pro version so
8:36:17
I went with one of the freebies and that's what I was able to do from it so every one of my texts came with that
8:36:23
animation as you see over here and over here so it's another nice addition that
8:36:28
we have with cap cut we can also do that with the vinture res but it's much more advanced much more complicated I don't
8:36:34
want you guys to jump into it if you like all this text animations and stuff you want to keep it easy stay on cap cut
8:36:40
and if you want to do much more Advance video editing and jump into how to make the text bounce and all that kind of
8:36:45
stuff it comes with splitting the text every time you want to make some certain change and going to the settings and
8:36:51
messing around with a lot of options here as well as the title which again I'm not going to get into it now because
8:36:57
it's over complicated it will take much longer to do it and I am trying to keep this relatively short so that is the
8:37:03
first video that I made on cap cut for the pet steam brush now let me show you the video that I created on the Vinci
8:37:09
resolve for the alarm door stopper or the way that we called it alarm Guard Pro and as you guys know I made the
8:37:15
mistake of buying the variation without the alarm so I had to compromise first let me show you the video and then let
8:37:21
me tell you what I did so let's take a look
8:37:30
[Music]
8:37:37
you guys notice that alarm sound okay so let's dissect what I did
8:37:44
here so I already showed you guys how to uh import the video and how to add the text and how to make it visible and all
8:37:50
of that as you see there's no special test text effects and that is fine except for just making it nice and
8:37:55
visible ible as we did with the black shadow shading over here so what I did here was I just showed this video where
8:38:01
I'm installing it and I have more videos that I still need to create like when I'm the burglar and here I'm running
8:38:06
away after the I sounded the alarm and there's a whole bunch of other stuff like here I'm saying hey be quiet I'm
8:38:13
about to intrude and now the alarm went off and oh gosh got to make a run for it so anyway I got more uh stuff to do here
8:38:20
but in any case as you saw in the first frame I was just installing it on the door in the second frame she's is no
8:38:25
longer afraid of intruders and burglars of course here I'm talking about my mother I bought this for my mother who was traveling alone this is kind of
8:38:32
similar to just imitating best practices from this Hagi store who has so much
8:38:38
success with this product he's uploading it every couple of days and he has so many views and it's all coming in
8:38:44
organically so he his winning copy says I bought this from my sister when she was traveling alone I don't want to copy
8:38:50
one by one so I'm just going to say I bought it from my mom okay so that is the first frame second one is she's no
8:38:56
longer afraid of intruders and burglars and what I did here is you you
8:39:02
see this video here that I added this is where the alarm sound is coming from because as you guys know I do not have
8:39:08
the variation with the alarm and I'm really sad that that's what came out of it but I had to get creative so what I
8:39:13
did here was I told myself okay I need to sound the alarm when I'm trying to open a door right here when I'm gripping
8:39:19
the knob and I'm trying to kind of open the door that that's when the alarm goes off with this product so so I hope that
8:39:26
my audience won't notice that there's no black alarm here where it's supposed to be hopefully they won't notice again we
8:39:32
got to live with our mistakes and get super creative with what we have and I don't have just time to order the product again so the way that I was able
8:39:39
to get the alarm sound was first I went to a free Sound Library uh and I was searching for alarm sounds but none of
8:39:45
them sounded like what this product sounds like so what I did then I was going through these Tik Tok videos for
8:39:51
the same exact product and I was looking for a video that sounds the alarm in the
8:39:57
video without background music because I already have background music in on my on my video and I don't want to have a
8:40:02
mix of background musics that you know one doesn't connect to the other so I looked for a video like that I found it
8:40:08
I think it was one of these maybe it was this one in any case what I did was I downloaded the video for some reason I
8:40:14
don't have the option to download here from my desktop I'm not sure why I guess maybe it's something new that Tik Tok
8:40:19
may be disabled maybe it's temporary I'm not sure so of course I just searched for a Tik Tok downloader online really
8:40:25
easy to find so I just searched Google for
8:40:31
download Tik Tok video I went to the first one it's called Snap tick. apppp paste the link over here click on
8:40:37
download and that's it you're good to go you're going to download the video and then I uploaded the media for that video
8:40:44
so it's this video over here so as you guys can see it's not my video but there is the part
8:40:50
here you guys can hear it where the alarm goes off so that's the part that I
8:40:56
wanted so what I did was I dragged this whole video to the timeline exactly to the part where I start to try to open
8:41:03
the door which is right here so I put the video right here and then I turned
8:41:08
off the video by clicking on this button so if I enable it you'll be able to actually see it in the video on my
8:41:15
timeline but I don't want to see it I only want to hear it so I disabled the video track but I kept the audio track
8:41:22
which is this one over here and you can see that this is where the the alarm actually comes on where the sound wve
8:41:27
started so I turned off the video I kept the audio and that way I was able to
8:41:32
import the sound of the alarm for the same product and that's how it actually came out right there so once I finished
8:41:38
this video I went on ahead and clicked on file quick
8:41:44
export I kept it on h.264 I left everything as is and I
8:41:49
clicked on export and that brought me to this file right here so it's under video
8:41:56
ads alarm door stopper the exports folder and this is
8:42:02
the video I turned the background music down
8:42:09
a lot cuz I don't want people to be too focused on it but as you guys can see it
8:42:14
matches in pretty well we hear the alarm going off from that other video that I
8:42:21
added open the door get yours now with free shipping okay so that is the first
8:42:26
copy that is the first video that I made for every one of these products and now I'm going to go ahead and make more
8:42:33
creatives more videos and I'm going to show you the results of everything as soon as I finish
8:42:55
all right so I finished editing five short videos for the fer Miss Trio product or in other words the pet steam
8:43:01
brush so I did it all through cap cut and I added all of the effects all of the text that I showed you guys how to
8:43:07
do so I want to show you guys the five quick clips that I made here and then I'm going to move on to creating the
8:43:14
rest of the clips for the alarm door stopper so that is going to be next so you so you can see here that I exported
8:43:20
the five short videos so let's start with the fifth one which is this one this is the last one and I want to show
8:43:27
you guys some extra things that I did here so let's play and watch the timeline as well let me just zoom in a
8:43:33
bit on the timeline all right let's play this video my cats are in love with this new grooming brush it's a streamer
8:43:41
massager and hair remover your furry friend will love it and it's so easy to
8:43:47
use just add some water and show your pets some love it's healthy and
8:43:53
effective for both cats dogs it's amazing how good this works get yours
8:43:59
now with fast shipping so first of all you may notic that all of my Clips are under 30
8:44:05
seconds because I just noticed that that's what all the best practices are doing and here I mixed and matched a few
8:44:11
different things so first I started with uh this hook my cats are in love with this new grooming brush so anyone who
8:44:17
has cats will be curious to stay for a few more seconds and see what this is about then it moved on to this screen
8:44:25
right here which is not my video so here I mixed what other sellers other
8:44:30
competitors are doing with their videos what they have in their videos I just downloaded it and I kind of added it to
8:44:36
my video as well now here's the thing as I said you shouldn't use a whole video from someone else from A to Z you can if
8:44:43
you need some media that's missing in your videos you can cut some of their videos and add it to yours as well but
8:44:50
just make sure that the hook is completely yours right I recorded this hook and anything else that you want to
8:44:55
add you can add some small Snippets here and there so that's exactly what I did here because they showed the product in
8:45:01
action much better than I was able to and that is simply because I believe they had much more time than me so I am
8:45:08
going to take these little Parts which I wasn't able to do and then I continued
8:45:13
adding my parts my recordings so you can see here how the cat kind of falls down
8:45:19
and once more and then we're moving on to it's so easy to use just add some
8:45:24
water and here I did speed up the clips so if you notice that you made some
8:45:29
recordings and you're adding it to your video editor and you notice that some clips are just moving a little bit too
8:45:36
slow then what you can do is simply speed up the clip so what I did here was I added this clip right where you just
8:45:41
add some water but I was kind of moving too slow with it so what I did was I clicked on the clip in the timeline and
8:45:47
then I clicked here on speed and I just moved the speed up and you're kind of just testing it here so you know you
8:45:53
kind of play with with the speed and see what speed matches what the user should be seeing and I sped up the next clip as
8:46:01
well because here I was also kind of moving slow and I wanted the clip to not be too long so you can see that here we
8:46:07
have a two times speed here as well and then I ended it with this clip from
8:46:13
another clip so what I did here was I just mixed and matched two different recorders I'm one recorder and one of my
8:46:19
competitors is the other one just make sure again that the hook is yours and that you're not using all of their video
8:46:25
even if it's not only in the hook so let's see the rest of the videos you guys already watched one when I finished
8:46:30
it and you just watched five now so let's just watch two three and four and then I will continue to the next product
8:46:37
so here's video number two and here I started with this hook so you guys may notice that I'm testing out a few
8:46:42
different things one as I mentioned and it's the most important thing is the hook so different text different
8:46:47
sentence different opening and try of course to catch your viewers attention as much as you possibly can so here I
8:46:54
went with calling all for parents and that is simply because that is what I saw one of our competitors doing uh this
8:47:02
one right here that made 31,000 views calling all for parents so okay let's try that as well and of course with
8:47:09
different text so this time I went with this uh yellow and with the black outline so I'm testing out a whole bunch
8:47:15
of things and you do want every video to not be very similar to the previous one so there can be some significant
8:47:21
differences and you can see which one is going to work and when you find a working one you can make more variations
8:47:26
that are more similar to it okay so let's watch this one calling all fur parents this firest Trio brush will
8:47:32
clean and massage your free friends so what I did here was I gave the product's name out and I didn't call it pet hair
8:47:40
steam remover because it's going to be easy to see hundreds of competitors who are also selling this product so I gave
8:47:47
it the name here this ferus Trio brush it makes grooming fun and easy just add
8:47:52
some water turn it on and the Magic Begins I'm so glad I got this for my
8:47:58
cats every cat and dog owner should spoil their free friends give them the
8:48:04
spa they truly deserve get yours now with fast shipping I ended all videos
8:48:10
pretty much with the same get yours now with fast shipping I just noticed that all the viral videos had the get yours
8:48:15
now in the end and I just wanted to add the with fast shipping just because this
8:48:21
is something that I know people are looking for I've been Drop Shipping for over eight years now now and fast shpping is one of the most important
8:48:27
things so I just want to make sure that my viewers know not only should you get it now but it's also going to arrive
8:48:32
relatively quickly all right let's watch video number three and this time I started with its furry Spa time so
8:48:39
something a little bit entertaining oh what are they going to do with the spa and here I went with a green text color
8:48:45
with a black outline it's furry Spa time introducing firest Trio the brush that
8:48:51
steams massages and removes un wanted f it's so easy to use and your pets will
8:48:58
thank you just add some water and give your pets the treatment they
8:49:03
deserve get yours now with fast shipping so you see kind of a different
8:49:09
ending this time I'm uh saying get yours now and I'm showing the product up close so first first it was its furry spot
8:49:15
time and then I went to another clip of course because I wasn't able to get this much hair off my cat and obviously this
8:49:22
is not real hair coming from this cat right here but they just did it pretty well and here I also liked how this cat
8:49:28
is really being massaged and kind of likes it so I kept that as well it's so
8:49:33
easy to use this time it's me with my cats add some water and give your pets
8:49:38
the treatment they deserve and you guys saw the rest and let that's it let's watch number four this time I I went
8:49:45
with the green again uh with a different hook every pet parent needs this
8:49:50
brush and the rest is just like we just saw so I'm not going to play it but this
8:49:56
is just like clip number three which I personally really liked and I just changed the hook so instead of its furry
8:50:04
spot time I change it to every pet uh pet parent needs this brush the rest of the video is exactly the same so I just
8:50:10
tried two different hooks here and this is what you should do only after you find the winner okay so let's say that
8:50:17
this is furry spot time one then I'm like oh okay I found my winner here let's make more videos relevant to this
8:50:23
one and we're just going to change a few small things every time and see if one hits even better than our winner cuz we
8:50:30
already have our winner so let's try to find out what was good about it and try to replicate that so we can get to more
8:50:35
and more audiences so this is what you would do in this case I just changed I deleted all the text I kept the same
8:50:42
videos the same cuts and everything on a timeline and just rewrote the text here okay so that is for the pet steam uh
8:50:49
brush uh I'm going to go with five videos I would even make 50 videos If I Had the Time as you guys know I'm kind
8:50:55
of short on that so I'm just putting everything in place showing you guys how to create the base for everything and
8:51:01
hopefully this will be very very successful for me as well so we are done with the pet steam brush now I'm going
8:51:07
to move over and create the next clips for the alarm door stopper so wish me
8:51:13
luck and I'll see you when I'm
8:51:21
done so one quick thing before I continue I noticed that I wasn't working with the right resolution on the Venture
8:51:27
resolve so I left that part out so here's what you want to do to work on the right resolution because I did
8:51:32
notice when I was trying to uh edit the video on cap cut see what I'm doing now is I want to try to create a copy of
8:51:40
this video with the text I want to make the text on cap cut with text to speech
8:51:45
with AI so I'm going to check two videos one that's like this what we're seeing here that you guys already saw and I
8:51:53
want to recreate a text on on cap cut where it will also have text to speech and then I can test two versions of the
8:51:58
same video one with text to speech and one without just to see if there's a really big difference between them and
8:52:04
then I'll work on different creatives for the rest of the videos so what I noticed was after I exported I just removed all the text here so I could add
8:52:11
it through cap cut so I could do the text to speech and uh after I exported the video and I imported it to uh cap
8:52:18
cut I noticed that there's something strange with the resolution and then I realized that I forgot to change the resolution on the Venture resolve so
8:52:24
here is how you're going to do that even after you edited the video what I what you need to do is you're going to click
8:52:31
on file and then project settings and here you've got the timeline resolution
8:52:36
so here you want to click on use vertical resolution once you do that it'll do the work for you and change it
8:52:43
to the right resolution so that everybody who's going to watch a short video will not watch a WID screen when
8:52:48
they're actually on portrait and not on landscape which is the right format for the short videos so what it did also was
8:52:55
it really zoomed in on the video and I fixed that by simply clicking on the video timeline and then clicking here to
8:53:03
make sure that it fits Because the actual size is way too
8:53:09
big as you can see right here we don't want it to be this much zoomed in so again you're going to click here you're
8:53:14
going to click on fit and it'll make sure that it fits inside and so what we want to do now is fix the text here I
8:53:20
already fixed it but you can see for the rest it's really small because this was what the size was before we resized the
8:53:26
project settings to be vertical so what I want to do is have all of the text this big so what I did was I clicked on
8:53:32
the text box here and I simply dragged the size to make it bigger so again I
8:53:37
can just go to the next one and in order to preview it I need to put the timeline on it too this uh marker on the timeline
8:53:45
and now I can play with the size as you can see right here but I want it all to be the same size exactly the same size
8:53:52
so in order to do that I'm going to go back to the previous text box and I'm just going to copy this size
8:53:57
right here and I'm going to go to this text box and I'm going to paste it over here which in this case it looks like
8:54:04
they're both exactly the same which is kind of rare but let's go to the third
8:54:10
one and we can see that it's not so I'm just going to paste the size over here so now you can see that it's the same
8:54:16
size now let's go to the fourth one again you can see that the size is really small so let's click on the text
8:54:21
box and change the size and same thing for the last one change the size okay so
8:54:28
I'm going to export this video again and hopefully this time it will export with the right resolution well not hopefully
8:54:33
I know it will so let's do a quick export export and this goes inside the
8:54:39
video ads alarm door stopper exports uh alert Guard Pro one I'm going
8:54:45
to call it text fix not text but resolution fix just so that I can test both versions and I won't overwrite the
8:54:52
previous one and then I'll remove the previous one okay so this export is finished let's go back alarm door
8:54:58
stopper exports and okay so you can see here even when I open this video you can see all the black here on the left and
8:55:05
right this wouldn't have come out good it would have come out really small if I would have put it in portrait you would
8:55:10
have seen a lot of black and white on the sides and this is the new export with the fixed resolution so you can see
8:55:16
that there are no borders on the left and right it starts and ends exactly where it should and this is what we were
8:55:23
looking for okay and this is the same thing that cap cut was already doing for us so let's just take a look open one of
8:55:30
the pet steam brushes here are the exports okay and you can see that um the borders here are also good okay so it
8:55:37
works good on both sides and that is just a quick little tip so again like I said what I'm going to do now is I'm
8:55:43
going to remove all of the text from the original video and I want to test that on a cap cut so I'm just going to remove
8:55:49
all the text like this then I'm going to export this but before that let's organize our files a bit so we won't get
8:55:55
confused later on as to what we did so let's go back to the alarm door stopper and remove the
8:56:02
first export with the wrong resolution and just keep this one so this is alert Guard Pro one and now let's work on two
8:56:08
which is going to be just like one only this time with a text to uh speech with AI and then three new creatives so I'm
8:56:14
going to show you how I'm going to do that really really quickly to make the text changes so what I did was I removed
8:56:20
all the text boxes right so you can see that the video is going on now without any text next and what I'm going to do
8:56:25
now I'm also going to remove the background music I'm going to try different background music as well so this I think is the background music
8:56:31
let's make sure yeah now there's no background music and there's no text so I'm just going to take this and I'm going to edit
8:56:38
that some more through cap cut just for the uh new music and uh text to speech AI which by the way you can also do on
8:56:44
the Vinci resolve you can do text to speech but that is a paid add-on and it gets a little bit complicated and to be
8:56:51
honest I really like the Vinci resolve and that is why I'm recommending that in this video as well if you like cap cut
8:56:57
and it gets the job done go ahead and use that personally I like the Venture resolve it's less buggy it doesn't crash
8:57:03
on me I don't need to pay any money for all of the features that I see here and the more you get into it the more you
8:57:09
see how customizable it is much much more than cap cut but if you're just here to create a quick short video for
8:57:15
your products both can get the job done and capcut does have the upper hand because it does have a few shortcuts for
8:57:21
creating these short videos but again to each your own pros and cons okay so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
8:57:26
export the video from the Vinci resolve without music without text so quick
8:57:32
export I'm just going to call it door stopper no audio and text and I'm going
8:57:38
to put this under pet steam brush no I'm just going to put it under downloads cuz I'm going to remove it later I'm not going to use it okay so I'm just going
8:57:44
to export it there okay and I'm going to import it through cap cut so let's open up cap
8:57:50
cut new project click on media import
8:57:56
media go to my downloads folder and it was this one so you can see that this resolution here is wrong
8:58:01
you can see all the black borders on the sides and this here is the right one okay so let's add this to the timeline
8:58:08
okay here we go and now I just need to add music and text so I'm going to use the same exact text so what I'm going to
8:58:13
do is I'm going to open the original video just so that I will have all the text that I had in the original so it's
8:58:20
this one okay so the first text is I bought this for my mother who was traveling alone so I'm going to add a
8:58:26
new text field on a timeline change a text I
8:58:32
bought this for my I'm going to go with mom instead of mother sounds less formal
8:58:39
who was traveling alone then we're going to add text to speech you're using the
8:58:46
tech and now we're going to edit the text so I bought this for and then my
8:58:54
mom who was traveling alone and now we're going to go with monserat my
8:58:59
favorite font for short videos and we are going to make the text
8:59:04
a bit bigger a little bit higher not too high up and we're going to choose the
8:59:09
effects the outlines for the text I'm going to go with this one pretty basic looks good noticeable and gets the job
8:59:16
done okay so it's going to start like this I bought this for my mom who was traveling alone okay now of course I'm
8:59:23
going to add music I'm going to add the rest of the text so now it's a pretty much rinse and repeat process so I'm going to just go to the video and look
8:59:30
for the next text piece she is no longer afraid of intruders and burglars I'm just going to
8:59:36
copy this previous text move a little bit forward past it here and she is no
8:59:42
longer afraid of intruders and burglar she is no longer afraid of intruders and
8:59:50
burglars text to speech you're using the so the only thing here is that I don't
8:59:55
have to choose the monster ad font again and I don't have to choose the text outline again I just have to add the
9:00:00
text to speech and then space out the text after adding the text to speech so she is no longer afraid of intruders and
9:00:07
burglars she is no longer afraid of intruders and burglars okay so I'm just
9:00:12
going to always make sure that the text is as long as the um audio and vice versa okay so I'm going to continue I'm
9:00:18
going to rinse and repeat this process I'm going to add background music then I'll work on new creatives so I'll see
9:00:23
you all when I'm
9:00:43
done all right that's it I'm done creating 10 video copies so there are
9:00:48
five videos for the pet steam brush and five videos for the alarm door stopper or of course with the new original name
9:00:53
names that I came up with with the help of chat GPT so as you know I worked on the Vinci resolve for the alarm door
9:00:59
stopper and I worked on cap cut for the pet steam brush and I kind of mixed in
9:01:05
both when needed so you guys saw my results for the pet steam brush here are the videos for the alert Guard Pro and
9:01:11
since you already saw the first one we're just going to go with the second third fourth and fifth so let's go ahead
9:01:17
and see what I came up with here's video number two for the alert Guard Pro or the alarm door stopper
9:01:24
and it's the same as the first one the only difference is that here I made it
9:01:29
on cap cut as I said I was going to do with text to speech with AI and this is
9:01:35
with the Vinci resolve so this was the first video with no text to
9:01:40
speech okay and uh low volume background music and so here I changed the
9:01:45
background music the text and the not the text it's not the creatives for the text but the uh format the sizing and
9:01:52
the text to AI so here's how it came out I bought this for my mom who was traveling alone she is no longer afraid
9:01:59
of intruders and burglars if someone tries to enter the door is locked and
9:02:04
the alarm will go off it's very easy to use and keeps you safe get yours now and
9:02:10
keep the bad guys away okay so this whole video was kind of like the first one just with the changes that I
9:02:15
mentioned and it only has this view there are no other uh camera angles and no other creatives so that is video
9:02:22
number two to test that that uh AB testing with video number one now let's check out video number three so here of
9:02:29
course I changed the creative this is me the robber and I started with a real
9:02:34
sentence this is a fact there are over 1 million burglaries every year in the us alone and so this was made on uh Da
9:02:41
Vinci resolve let's go ahead and check it out
9:02:49
[Music]
9:03:04
so you guys may have noticed here so there are a few changes one there's it's starting with uh the burglar itself I'm
9:03:09
not sure if this is the best idea cuz we're not showing the product and it takes about 4 seconds into the video to
9:03:15
actually show the product so it's not always the best idea but I'm always here to try new things as well as also uh
9:03:21
continue with our best practice is and the last thing is that towards the end
9:03:27
of the creative I added a part of someone else's video because it actually shows the alarm where you know I don't
9:03:34
have this uh black Square for the alarm because you guys know that I'm an idiot and I ordered the wrong variant so I
9:03:40
added that as well to the end and that's it everything else is my creative and this part I just took from someone else
9:03:46
so that is video number three video number four is similar to video number three only this time I created it on cap
9:03:53
cut because I do want to test it with uh text to speech with the AI voice over
9:03:58
and I changed the last part in the end without adding uh the other person's uh video so here's how it came
9:04:06
out and then different background music also as [Music]
9:04:21
well okay and then I showed the unlock uh mechanism instead of the other guy's video and the fifth and last video right
9:04:30
here so here I did something a little bit uh different I took the video that I just did on number four on da Vinci
9:04:36
resolve and I did it again on a cap cut only with uh as you guys know the AI text to speech I didn't have that much
9:04:42
time for creatives on this video so I'm just doing a whole bunch of AB testing on this product whereas on the pet steam
9:04:47
brush I did have room for a little bit more creatives so here I'm doing the AI again text to speech and I added another
9:04:54
small effect where you can easily do it on cap cut you can also do it on the Vinci res just a little more advanced but what I did was I just uh edited the
9:05:01
text a little bit inside let me show you uh what it looks like this is the Vinci
9:05:06
this is cap cut so what you can do is you can just grab text okay and then you
9:05:11
can take whatever part you want on that text like let's say I want the word anyone to change it so I'm just going to
9:05:17
double click it here in the text and then I'm just going to click on whatever text effect I want to use and um that's
9:05:23
how you do it so it's really easy to do it here on a cap cut and On Da Vinci the way to do it is to make a split on the
9:05:29
text on a timeline so like let's say I'm going to make a split here and here and then that split in the middle I would
9:05:35
click on the text I would click on the split click on the text and make the changes that you want to make so I'm not
9:05:41
going to again show it here as I mentioned it's a little bit more Advanced Techniques but everything is possible cap cut has a little bit more
9:05:47
shortcuts and the Vinci has much more features much more editing options much
9:05:52
more customization just a little bit more advanced but it's all for free so it's a great great package and um that's it so as you guys
9:05:59
know I use the free version of cap cut and I used Da Vinci resolve there's not even a paid version it's completely free
9:06:05
and so here's the fifth and final video just like the fourth from Da Vinci the fifth one was made through cap cut with
9:06:11
the additional AI voice over and additional text effects there are over 1 million burglaries every year in the us
9:06:19
alone and back the alarm Guard Pro prevents breaking and entering simply
9:06:24
place it under your door if anyone tries to enter the built-in alarm will
9:06:29
activate and will scare off the bad guys it's portable and easy to use get yours
9:06:35
now with fast shipping and stay safe okay guys wish me luck these are the
9:06:41
videos that we're going to go with and so we finished recording and editing the videos for the short form video organic
9:06:47
marketing so the next step is to create our social media accounts and to post these videos on those accounts and to
9:06:55
hope that some of them are going to be winning videos they're going to go viral people are going to click on it they're
9:07:01
going to go to our bios on the link in the bio go to our product page and hopefully purchase the product before we
9:07:07
move on to the next step which is paper click marketing or paid marketing where we are going to put a budget on some of
9:07:13
these videos so that we can reach more audiences scale these videos and make much more sales and profit so let's
9:07:20
create our social media accounts now and prepare our products for marketing okay so now that our short form organic
9:07:26
content is ready we are going to post it on our social media accounts and let's go ahead and jump right into that so we
9:07:32
did a lot of work so far and we used two different tools to do it the Venture resolve and cap cut you can do whatever
9:07:38
you want whatever fits for you if you do not want to edit the videos yourself just go ahead and use fiverr's ugc
9:07:43
Creator you can hire someone to do it for you if you've got the budget for it and that is the best way to get it done there so now that we have our videos no
9:07:50
matter what direction we went with when it comes to getting the videos for our products now we're ready to post them
9:07:57
and according to the Shopify droping cheat sheet you can see right here that it says to create a Tik Tok account a
9:08:03
Facebook page you don't have to create a new Facebook account you can create another page under your current account you'll also need to create another
9:08:09
YouTube account and an Instagram account and the purpose of this is so that we can post this short form video content
9:08:15
and get these videos to go viral so that when people view the video they look at the product they'll click on the link
9:08:21
that we add to the bio and they'll get taken to our website so the link in the video or the or the link in BIO is
9:08:28
what's going to take them to the product page and that is where we want the customers of course to purchase the product and we will ship it out to them
9:08:34
so let's go ahead and do that now one thing before that is I did want to make
9:08:39
a change to this logo I just didn't really like the font used here inside the logo so I went back to canva and I
9:08:45
just changed the uh text effects to uh just look a little bit more professional
9:08:51
and I also added this little crown over here so again this is using the free version of canva I didn't use anything
9:08:57
that's paid I didn't use anything premium to create this icon and what I did here was I simply searched for the word Crown because okay something that
9:09:04
connects with Prime and I don't want to put like monkeys because it's a jungle or anything like that so I was like okay
9:09:10
Prime means you're at the top means you are king or queen so I searched for the
9:09:16
uh element called crown and I got this yellow one right here and then I just clicked on it I edited to open up the
9:09:22
effects and I added two effects here so one is a shadow and the shadow that I used here was a regular old drop shadow
9:09:29
and I also changed the color to Green because that is a part of our brand colors here so after I changed the color
9:09:35
to Green it pretty much looks good now so I'm just going to download this one and we're going to upload this one and
9:09:41
the reason I'm doing it now is because before we start creating it on our social media accounts we will need to upload a logo there too and I want it to
9:09:47
look good in all fronts so okay I'm just going to download this one as is and
9:09:52
let's just put put it in its respective folder so this is the prime jungle logo
9:09:58
and we've also got the cover image which I don't remember where I saved it so I want to put it in the right folder so
9:10:04
let's go back to that image okay so here's the cover image which we will keep I'm just going to make sure that
9:10:11
this time it's saved where I can see it so here we're going to go with page one
9:10:16
the header and I'm not going to need the footer so that's good enough okay so now
9:10:23
I have everything saved uh so first I'm going to edit it on the Shopify store the logo so let me just upload the right
9:10:29
logo here so we're going to click on change select from library add images
9:10:35
and navigate to where that is saved okay then I'm going to go ahead and click on done and save so we got the logo now
9:10:42
that looks better it's ready maybe the I do think that maybe the placement of the crown maybe should be a little higher up
9:10:48
and smaller but okay that's just me the perfectionist let's leave it as is it's good enough to move forward and next
9:10:54
what I want to do is finally disable the password on my store because I'm going to get people to enter the store now and
9:11:00
we don't want a password protected store by any chance by any means so the way that we're going to do that is going to
9:11:06
our online store and here you see where it says your online store is password protected we're simply going to remove
9:11:11
the password and now the online store is open to anyone here you can also get some more information like the loading
9:11:18
speed which needs to be good very good make sure that it's not too slow and if it is you probably we have too much
9:11:24
things going on too many images maybe embedded videos and things like that okay so this is the front page of my
9:11:30
website and as you can see it's really small I need to fill it in with more products but we already have all of the
9:11:37
things that we need to get started so we can already start driving traffic to the store which is what we're going to do now but after I create the organic
9:11:44
videos and I will post them on my social media accounts I will add more products here because it doesn't look good to
9:11:49
only have two products and as I mentioned I'm going to add relevant products similar products to those that
9:11:54
I'm already selling so I'm going to add more pet products and I'm going to add more home security products and of course I'm going to expand to more and
9:12:01
more categories but for now I just want to fill up the store with more links but you can see that we already have
9:12:06
everything ready to get started this store is almost ready to get traffic and so when I start to add more products I'm
9:12:12
also going to add categories to these products and categories on Shopify is called Collections and the reason that I
9:12:18
want to do that is because I'm going to have multiple products and I don't just want to throw people a whole bunch of
9:12:24
products in their face without organizing and categorizing them so in order to do that we've got autods to
9:12:29
help us with that so we're going to open up the item editor for one of these products and you can see that we've got
9:12:35
the collections tab right here so this is where we can add new categories or place them in categories that already
9:12:41
exist on our stores so if I also open up the uh collections tab here on Shopify in the left menu which under products
9:12:47
you can see that we only have one collection or one category in other words and that's the homepage so what we can do here is we can create the
9:12:54
collections here but it'll just be easier to do it through autods so here in the collections I'm going to create a
9:13:00
category for this product which in this case is going to be home security okay
9:13:05
and because I don't have this collection at the moment you can see this plus button it's going to create a new
9:13:11
collection a new category called home security and now I'm simply going to save it okay okay and now if I refresh
9:13:18
the page on Shopify you can see that it created this collection called Home Security okay so that worked and let's
9:13:25
do the same for the pet steam brush which by the way it's time to rename it and we are going to rename it to what
9:13:31
Chad GPT helped us with which was fmst Trio all right so let's rename that
9:13:37
since we're already here so this is firmest Trio 3 in one electric steam pet
9:13:45
brush for cats and dogs and I'm not going to leave the rest cuz it's just making the title a little bit too long
9:13:52
okay so we're going to save that that you can see that it was updated so now if I go to Shopify and I refresh we should see it
9:14:00
here okay there it is fish Trio 3in1 electric steam pet brush for cats and dogs and the second thing we want to do
9:14:06
is add it to a collection so this collection is going to be called or this category is going to be called pet
9:14:11
products or pet supplies let's think of a nice name for this category let's see what AliExpress calls pets pet supplies
9:14:18
and let's also get another example from other big companies and this this is the same practices that you guys should be
9:14:24
doing on your stores as well take practices from what is working from big
9:14:30
big competitors pet supplies okay so we're going to call it pet supplies as well okay so back on autods we're going
9:14:36
to create a collection called pet supplies click on it to create it save it okay and you can see that this one
9:14:43
was saved as well so if I go back to Shopify to the collections page I'm going to refresh it and now I've got pet
9:14:48
supplies as well okay so now that our categories are ready what we can do is also linked to it but I'm going to do
9:14:54
all of that stuff later because now it's time to get our stores ready for social media so I'm going to show you how to do
9:15:00
that later but basically it's very very simple if you remember we went to online store and then we had the navigation
9:15:05
menu and then here we can create more menus so here on the main menu we already have one called products which
9:15:12
leads to all of our products so it kind of randomizes whatever products we have and it just throws it out there so what
9:15:18
we're going to do here is we can create a category for example called all products or a link called all products
9:15:25
and that will link to our collections then it's going to ask you wait which collections all of your collections like
9:15:31
all of your categories or do you want to show them the home security category or the pet supplies category and so here
9:15:36
I'm going to show them all the categories and then what happens now is if anyone clicks on our front page here
9:15:42
it's going to be all products instead of products and then instead of just throwing whatever products we have in our stores it's going to show the
9:15:49
categories instead but first I want to fill it up with products and then I'm going to do that all right so let's get to it let's create our social media
9:15:55
accounts so I already created a quick account on Tik Tok and here is the thing with Tik Tok really important to take
9:16:02
this part in so when you're creating an account on Tik Tok you have to think about your organic audience's location
9:16:08
so if you want to get if you want this organic video or these organic videos to reach a certain audience in a certain
9:16:15
location but you're not from that region then they're most likely not going to see it at least not right from the start
9:16:21
so in order to get the Right audience the ones that you want in a specific region that's not related to where you
9:16:27
live you're going to have to either live there in that location which in this case you don't you can use VPN services
9:16:33
and do this before creating your Tik Tok account and make sure that you're not logged into any other Tik Tok account at
9:16:39
that time so log out of everything and use a highquality VPN in my case I'm
9:16:44
using nordvpn you can use whatever VPN service you want and this is simply going to help you get an IP from a
9:16:50
different location so right now I chose the United States because that is the target audience that I want to get on
9:16:56
Tik Tok and in order to reach them I need to make the browser think or Tik Tok think that I'm also from there so
9:17:02
I'm using nordvpn we can see here the pricing page for nordvpn but it doesn't matter if you're going to use them or
9:17:09
any other service that is only if you use a 2-year plan then it's going to be relatively cheap or the one-year plan
9:17:14
one month plan is a little bit more expensive the basic is more than enough but that's the price of a high quality
9:17:21
VPN and there are a bunch of other VPN Services out there but I still think that it's worth it especially if you
9:17:27
want to get on Tik Tok and I really think that you should and this way we're going to be able to get to our audiences
9:17:33
now when we run ads it's a different story because when we run ads on Tik Tok or Facebook or wherever then the
9:17:39
platform will ask us okay which audience do you want to Target in the whole world because you're paying these platforms
9:17:45
money so they'll do whatever you want to do or almost anything you want to do but here organically it's a different story
9:17:51
so what I did was I logged out of my Tik Tok account I opened up nordvpn or whatever VPN service you want to use
9:17:57
connect to an IP address in the same location that you want to Target and again this is only for the organic
9:18:02
section and now we're going to start posting these videos and another thing that is worth mentioning when creating
9:18:07
your Tik Tok account is I suggest I recommend doing it on the web in other
9:18:13
words do it from your Chrome browser and use sign up by email so let me just show
9:18:19
you really quick let me just open up incognito since I'm already logged in and I'm going to write Tik Tok sign up
9:18:24
okay so here and then here instead of going with use phone or email don't do that and also don't go with continue
9:18:30
with Facebook just go with continue with Google and it will prompt you to log into your Google account and connect it
9:18:36
with Tik Tok and the reason that I suggest doing that is if you go with use phone or email then okay you can use
9:18:43
here instead of writing your phone number because it'll know where you're actually from you can go with to sign up by email and you're using a VPN and
9:18:49
everything here sounds good but after you register it's going to ask you to open up your Tik Tok on your mobile app
9:18:55
and scan the code on the browser and this way it's going to know that you're not from where you say that you are from
9:19:01
because your phone has a different IP and you don't want to start working with different SIM cards from different locations and vpns inside your mobile
9:19:09
phone it makes everything much more complicated so the trick here is to use continue with Google sign into your
9:19:15
Google account and it won't prompt you to download the Tik Tok app so that is how I was just able to register a really
9:19:21
quick account using a IP and I can tell that it is really working because all
9:19:26
these videos on my feed are not from my location this is all from the US and
9:19:31
it's uh really popular uh topics and uh people uh going viral right now around
9:19:37
the US and again it's really easy to notice that so that's how I know that it's actually working and that Tik Tok
9:19:43
thinks that I'm from there so now if I post a video on this account it's going to show it to the US audience so that is
9:19:49
great I got what I wanted and now you know how to do it as well so before I upload my videos I am going to make a
9:19:56
few changes of course I don't want my picture here in the profile so I'm going to go to view profile and it just took
9:20:03
the image from Google it's also a really bad one so I'm going to click here on edit profile my username is going to be
9:20:10
prime jungle let's see if we got room for that yes nobody's using prime jungle that's nice okay and now is my name and
9:20:17
the bio and this is where people are going to go to after seeing my video on Tik Tok and now this part is a little
9:20:24
bit tricky because I am going to probably take them to the collections page because I'm going to upload two
9:20:31
different products here and if I only link to let's say this product right the ferus Trio but then they watch the other
9:20:39
video they watch the alert guard video then they're not really going to understand why they saw a video of one
9:20:45
product they went to the Linkin bio and they saw another product so there are two solutions to this you can create one
9:20:51
Tik Tok account for every product that you want to sell and there are a few more things that you can do here so if
9:20:56
you don't want to create one Tik Tok account for every product that you want to sell by the way you can add call to
9:21:01
action links inside the video only when you run paperclick ads but because we're doing it now organically we have to kind
9:21:07
of get creative on these topics so another thing that we can do is create a
9:21:12
uh category create a collection that's not going to be linked anywhere on our website but that collection has only
9:21:18
these two products so if anyone saw the video of the fmus trio and I would link to this page where they
9:21:24
can see only these two products for the two products that I'm running uh organic marketing on then they'll quickly know
9:21:30
which one they need to click on but if I send them to the category of pets and they'll see a whole bunch of pet
9:21:35
products they will most likely leave the website really quick because they couldn't find the product that they saw from the video so that is another way to
9:21:42
do it and that's what I'm going to do and the third way to do it is to create a link tree which is free to use of
9:21:49
course they do have a paid option but you definitely do not need that and what you can do here is you can link to your
9:21:55
link tree page and you're going to create a link tree with just two links so one link is for this product and one
9:22:02
link is to that product and if you have too many products that you're running organic marketing on then this is probably not going to be a good idea but
9:22:08
in any case what you can do here is create a quick template it's really really easy to do and once you choose
9:22:14
whatever template you want you add the links inside so the link in BIO will take you to your link tree page and
9:22:20
there they can click on the link to the product that they want to purchase okay so that is another way to do it and again you can always just create one Tik
9:22:27
Tok account for every product that you want to sell Tik Tok doesn't really limit at least not at the moment the amount of accounts that you can create
9:22:32
there okay but in this case I'm just going to create a collection for it okay so I'm going to go to autods open up the
9:22:38
item editor for each one of those products okay so we're going to create another collection and I'm going to call
9:22:44
it trending okay save that you can create as many collections as you want for every product and of course I'm also
9:22:51
going to add it to the alert guard Pro so I'm going to open that up on autods add it to trending and save okay and now
9:22:58
on Shopify if I go to my products and collections you can see that we now have
9:23:03
the trending uh collection with two products inside which is those that we just added through autods okay so now
9:23:08
the two products are here and now I simply want the link to this so that I can send it to my audiences so you can
9:23:15
see here I clicked on a view here on Shopify while I was inside the collection and here you can see that I'm
9:23:21
inside a collection called Trend trending you know what maybe we should call it uh trending products I can also
9:23:27
do it here and it'll update on autods as well but it's always best to do it from
9:23:32
there okay and after I refresh we can see it here so trending products and this is what we're going to take them to
9:23:37
so every time they click the link in the bio they're going to see the product that they sign in the video and they're going to uh purchase it hopefully okay
9:23:44
and that should be that okay so we have the link I'm going to leave it here and let's continue with our Tik Tok bio so
9:23:51
let's copy the link link get it here and I'm going to leave
9:23:57
the link right here okay set username and nickname you can change it every 30 days every 7 days no problem confirm it
9:24:05
okay and here it is done I by the way I changed my name to Prime jungle as well so we're seeing Prime jungle Prime jungle twice I don't really mind that
9:24:11
and here you have the get it here and the link now they will have to uh copy and paste until you reach uh 1,000
9:24:17
followers if I'm not mistaken and only then the link in bu becomes clickable okay so until then they're just going to
9:24:23
have to copy the link here and they're going to have to uh paste it and of course when people are going to start
9:24:28
commenting on the video you can also com in back with the link okay so it'll make it easier so when it comes to organic
9:24:34
the audience do have to do a little bit of work to get to the the link is not going to be clickable right from the start and that is just something that we
9:24:40
are going to have to take into uh consideration so you can use apps like bitly to make your links uh shorter um
9:24:46
you can use it it's absolutely free to use just create a free account and use this uh URL as your Source it will
9:24:52
create create a shorten version of it um but to be honest I don't think that this link is uh too long and I like that it has its own domain it looks a little bit
9:24:58
more uh authorative and I'm going to keep it like this uh I'm not sure I like slash collection so much and we can
9:25:04
change that later on Shopify but again it's a quick uh copy and paste okay so now let's edit the profile picture so
9:25:12
here I'm going to click on profile photo and I'm going to use the prime jungle logo okay make sure that it's nice and centered and click on apply and
9:25:19
everything else is well was pretty much done so we're going to save that and now it's refreshing and there we go okay so
9:25:26
our logo is ready our Tik Tok account is ready and we can post the first video let's go ahead and do that right now and
9:25:33
then I'll create the social media accounts on the rest of the social media platforms okay so we're going to click
9:25:38
here on upload and here it's telling me select a video to upload so again select video go into where you saved it and
9:25:44
let's start with the pet steam brush exports okay so let's start with the first one so pet team brush one and here
9:25:51
it will show you what it will look like on the user's uh Tik Tok account so you can see right here you got your logo here and you've got the video here and
9:25:58
you can see that the text is nice and big aligned correctly there are no border issues on the sides and it looks
9:26:04
pretty good you can click on play to see how it looks this a threein one steam brush that Combs massages and removes
9:26:11
fur my cats love it and my sister's dog okay so we get the point it looks good
9:26:16
so now we need to give it a description so here we need to well write a description
9:26:22
so you can use let's say you can get example from the creatives that you have here okay um or you can just write your
9:26:28
own creative you can ask chat GT to kind of help you with it as well I'm just going to write the description according to my best practices so calling all pet
9:26:37
lovers this is the grooming brush you've been looking for get it now with fast
9:26:44
and free shipping now as you can see here this is where they're going to see that message so so there's no reason to
9:26:50
put the link here nobody's going to be able to uh copy it and uh and click on it but I can also see that the text is a
9:26:56
little bit too long so fast and free shipping kind of they won't really be able to see it so this is the grooming
9:27:02
brush you've been looking for get yours now you can barely see it um I'll just
9:27:08
write Link in BIO there we go yeah we can see it uh too much exclamation point so I'm just going to put this little
9:27:13
Dash Okay so calling all pet lovers this is the grooming brush you've been looking for Link in BIO okay now we're
9:27:19
going to add a few uh hashtags so you want to do this because if people are going to search for a similar hashtag
9:27:25
and our video is doing well it's going to show up and it's just going to get even more and more viral so I'm going to
9:27:30
write a few hashtags that have to do with it you can write the first part right and then see what Tik Tok suggests
9:27:36
and how many posts you have around these words okay so one I'm going to call it pet and also pets of Tik Tok maybe pet
9:27:42
grooming pet groomers of Tik Tok that's we don't have too many post on that but we can try that as well let's also try
9:27:49
cats of Tik Tok cats lovers and also dogs swear that it's not giving me any
9:27:55
results okay dog lover um okay so that should be enough and yeah we're pretty much good to go so we got the video who
9:28:02
can watch the video everyone when to post you can post it now you can schedule it for later um in my case my
9:28:08
audience is not really awake right now so I will probably schedule the video for later and around my time it should
9:28:14
be around night time so maybe around evening around you know even 700 p.m.
9:28:21
7:30 should be good and then they should be awake they're just going to start getting up they're going to open up their Tik Tok accounts and this is
9:28:27
scheduled for today um I don't mind running a copyright check it's always good to do so because you don't want
9:28:32
your video taken down sometime and whether you notice it or not it's not always a good feeling okay so no issues
9:28:37
detected and that's because we used free music that we can use it's not copyrighted that we can use for commercial use so it shouldn't have any
9:28:44
problems and yeah here we go so 40 megabytes 27 seconds long this is the first video and we are going to go ahead
9:28:51
and and schedule it okay and now we can do the same for the rest of the videos so I'm going to
9:28:58
upload another video I'm going to select the second one and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to uh publish the first
9:29:03
three and the next two I'll leave it for tomorrow I just don't want to post five videos a day especially around the same
9:29:08
topic because I don't want it to show to to the same audiences I want the algorithm to refresh the audiences
9:29:14
tomorrow so that I could show it to a more broad audience more people that will open up their phones tomorrow or
9:29:20
that will open up Tik Tok tomorrow that didn't do it today okay so let's move on to video number two okay and this one
9:29:25
already says calling all for parents or okay so we're going to have to do another creative here I can't believe
9:29:31
how much my cat loves this Lincoln bio and we can also add emojis here so let's
9:29:37
go ahead and do that so here I'm going to go with okay animals and we're going to go with a cat back to Tik Tok okay
9:29:44
you can see the cat here as well and this was the second video If you guys remember brush will clean and massage
9:29:49
your free friends o I kind of went off there and easy and that is why I'm not going to fix it now it's not the end of
9:29:55
the world but that is why I suggested not to work at the limit always give it
9:30:01
a little bit less room okay don't work exactly at the edge because this is what's going to happen uh I did fix it
9:30:07
for the rest like I did not go to the edges for the rest of the text as you can see here so it's not that bad and
9:30:13
I'm not going to like I said change now cuz it's not that bad but I'm so glad I
9:30:18
got this we want to make it better okay so this is going to be the second video and let's do the hashtags again pet
9:30:24
lover cats of Tik Tok can also do pet grooming and I think that that is good
9:30:30
enough okay so I can't believe how much my cats love this link in BIO and we are going to schedule this one as well so
9:30:37
let's schedule also for around the same time
9:30:43
tonight so let's give it like a 15 minute difference between the two okay I can run a copyright check but I'm pretty
9:30:49
sure I know what the answer is here because we did everything the right way okay no issues detected and schedule
9:30:54
okay so I'm going to do the same thing for the rest of the videos and you already get the point you understand how
9:31:01
to do it so I'm going to jump onto the next social media channels and show you how to upload your short form content
9:31:06
there as well so we know how to do it on Tik Tok I can click here on manage posts to see the two scheduled posts that we
9:31:12
have out of the five okay so these are the two videos they both look good I hope that they will do a great job and
9:31:19
I'm going to post uh the other three as well so I'm going to post one more for today I'm going to schedule one more for today so I'm going to schedule three for
9:31:25
today with about 15 minute differences between them and then I'm going to schedule two more today but for tomorrow
9:31:31
so I'm going to do all my work today and that way tomorrow will also be taken care of so that is Tik Tok and let's see
9:31:36
how that is going to perform of course I'm going to come back to record in a couple of days from now and you will be able to see the results and I did have
9:31:44
trouble with Instagram I'm not sure why but there is probably a bug on the website so I wanted to create an account
9:31:50
on Instagram as well so I sent up for a new account I click on sign up and as you see I'm clicking and nothing happens
9:31:56
I tried deleting cookies and cash and and all of that nothing really works so it's just a bug on Instagram at the
9:32:02
moment so you will not skip them but I am going to skip them for this video just because they're not working and now
9:32:08
is the time that they should be working if they want to be in this video okay so that is Instagram we are going to do
9:32:14
Facebook pages so as I mentioned you can use the Facebook account that you already have on the left menu you'll
9:32:19
have a link called Pages click on that and then here you can create a new page so create new profile or page I'm going
9:32:26
to click on that and I'm going to go with public page because this is grow as a business Creator or organization and
9:32:33
the cool thing about uh Facebook is that we can really build a community here and that pretty much is what Facebook is all
9:32:38
about that's Facebook's Niche it's all around communities and that is what we're going to do here so we are going
9:32:44
to create a page and we're going to not just post the short form videos here but we're also going to upload uh images
9:32:51
with statuses with uh posts uh around the types of products that we are
9:32:57
selling just to get people to know that we are a brand here we are on Facebook we're active and we're uploading posts
9:33:03
we're uploading videos so you do want to stay active on Facebook just like the other social media channels as well each
9:33:09
one serves its purpose and while Facebook does have short videos just like Tik Tok does Tik tok's algorithm
9:33:15
does a much better job when it comes to short video content and its algorithms and Facebook also does okay when it
9:33:20
comes to reals but they're mainly here for the community so you're going to use Facebook more for community building for
9:33:26
brand building for brand authorization and trust and Tik Tok is going to be for getting lots of traffic through your
9:33:31
organic and also paid videos okay so create a page to engage new customers and fans we're going to click on get
9:33:37
started okay and first we've got the page name so in our case we know that it's going to be prime jungle and under
9:33:43
category we can go with something like shopping service okay and for the bio
9:33:49
here I'm just going to put the link not to the the uh category where we created the two products but rather to the main
9:33:55
page okay so Prime jungle. Star best deals on the net fast shipping period
9:34:00
Welcome to the Jungle and a link to the store okay we'll have more places to put the link to the store but I also want to
9:34:05
put it here as well so I'm going to click on create page all right so now we are going to finish setting up our page
9:34:11
so first we've got the uh website URL so we're going to put it here uh the email address that I opened for this store
9:34:19
just as a reminder I had to open it is Prim jungle store
9:34:25
gmail.com okay the address City town Zip Code I can I'm just going to add the
9:34:30
same as I put in my Shopify settings okay and we are always open 24 hours a
9:34:35
day okay now we're going to click on next we already have all the info that we need so this is a very easy
9:34:40
step-by-step process and that is why we're only doing this at this point and O I just got a sale $2.99 that's not bad
9:34:48
that's only like $7 $8 profit um so here we're going to the profile picture and the cover photo and of course this is
9:34:54
why we're doing this at this stage and not when when we get started with the store because we don't have all this info yet so that is why I'm placing
9:35:00
every part exactly when you need to do it okay so the profile picture I saved
9:35:06
it under the main folder so this is the profile picture and the cover photo is the same that we created for free on
9:35:13
canva okay and here we can drag to reposition which we kind of need to do that because you can see a lot of uh
9:35:18
empty white space here and this text is kind of kind of being blocked by the uh logo so let's just drag right here put
9:35:26
it a little bit higher and the icon actually looks pretty good okay so now
9:35:31
we're going to add an action button and this is what we want people to to do so there's going to be like a button here
9:35:37
on the page and we want them to go to our website so here what we want to do
9:35:42
is we don't want to use book now or sign up or even start order well that's more for a a restaurant anyway uh we can do
9:35:49
send message where they can just send you a message but I'd really just like to get them to
9:35:54
my website and so what we do want to choose here is right here learn more opens a website okay so I'm going to
9:36:01
click on that again you you can do buy now but your customer Your Shopper might
9:36:06
not even know what he wants to buy it so we do want to just have a learn more where it opens a website and here we are
9:36:13
going to add the link of course to our website so it's https Prime jungle. store click on Save
9:36:21
okay and now we can go ahead and click on next to continue all right next you can add your uh WhatsApp number I'm
9:36:27
going to skip this step and you can invite your friends I'm not sure if they're your target audience so we're just going to go ahead and click on next
9:36:32
and here we can turn off marketing and promotional emails and Page notifications on your profile you can
9:36:38
leave that on if you want to get notifications when people are engaging and doing stuff on it let's leave that on all right welcome to your new page
9:36:44
very easy very simple because we had all the information up front Okay so we got the cover image looks good we got the
9:36:50
logo looks good we created cre that for free on canva we use that on our website and here again what I suggest is to
9:36:56
start making posts on your Facebook profile on your Facebook page so here for example I can write a message okay
9:37:03
and let me just add a photo to one of the products that we are selling okay so here let me for example open up the uh
9:37:10
pet steam brush and let me just upload one of the images and here I'm going to write can anyone guess what this does
9:37:18
and then I'm going to link to ferace Trio so let me just get the link to it ooh very long link very long we're going
9:37:25
to have to redirect this one okay so let me show you really quick how to do that as well I don't want this really long link I I don't think it looks good uh
9:37:32
it's going to not look good when I link when I create such a long link and I put it in a post I can use a uh link
9:37:37
shortener like bitly like I showed you but still even when you're on the website and you see a title this long on
9:37:42
the slug it doesn't really look that good and that's because that was the first title that we went with so it already created that but I don't want
9:37:49
that so let's go ahead and change that now let's go to the product page really quick let's open up this product page
9:37:55
but not through here I can see that I'm on the online store editor so let's exit that click on products click on the
9:38:02
product and then scroll down to the SEO section that's this one right here so the search engine listing this is how
9:38:07
we're going to see it I'm going to click on the editor here and here you got the URL handle so this is the slug that I was talking about and this created from
9:38:14
the first title that we had for this product so here I'm just going to call it fist Trio or you know what just
9:38:20
firmest okay we're going to save that and what it does now is it's going to create a redirect so whoever goes to the
9:38:26
old link it will be redirected to the new link all right so now let's go back to the website and now if I refresh this
9:38:31
page you'll notice that the slug here the last part of the URL is going to change let's go back now let's click on
9:38:36
the product there we go so products slist so I'm just going to use this again you can use the URL shortener but
9:38:42
because we have our own domain I don't mind showing it off so it's a it's the
9:38:48
only brush you'll need for your furry friend and let's add an emoji so let's
9:38:54
go to the animals and we're going to have a cat and a dog learn more and get it with fast and free shipping here okay
9:39:03
and I'm going to leave the URL right here and we're going to click on post so this is something that you want to do on
9:39:09
the daily you can schedule your posts so you can you know work now on all of your week's posts and just do it so most
9:39:16
likely this is not going to go viral it's not going to go organic but when people will land on my Facebook page from other ways from other like from
9:39:22
organic marketing from uh the short videos they will get to my Facebook page as well I want them to see that this is
9:39:28
an active business we post things we're active we're here and uh again guys it only took me a couple of minutes to get
9:39:34
this page up and running it's really easy to create post once you have all the information and all the knowledge and this is what you want to do okay so
9:39:40
let's upload our reals so here on your profile right under the status changes you have the real button so I'm going to
9:39:46
click on that okay and here I'm going to click on ADD video and let's add the first pet team brush video so exports
9:39:53
first one I can't believe nobody told me about this let me go back my cats love
9:39:58
it yeah it's really annoying because it wouldn't let me kind of pause the video so what we want to do here is well the
9:40:04
the best part is when we compare to Tik Tok is here in in the post we can link to the product so it's going to be easy
9:40:10
for people to be able to click on the link and it doesn't have to be the link to the categories it will be the link to
9:40:16
the actual product that we're trying to sell so it's going to be a little bit better here so let me go back to it and just do the post because it doesn't let
9:40:22
me turn the volume down and I'm sure it's it's it's kind of annoying for you guys I'm just going to do it silently and you can see what I'm doing and I'm
9:40:27
sure that you guys know exactly what I'm doing cuz I trained you well enough so let me just go ahead and get this done
9:40:33
so again we're going to click here on real and I'm going to get
9:40:44
started okay so while it's uploading the real I just want to talk about a couple of things so one on Facebook it's
9:40:50
different than uh Tik Tok well that's obvious but it's different because of the following reasons on Facebook you do
9:40:55
not have to log into a different IP a Facebook reals will just show it to anyone and same thing for YouTube only
9:41:02
Tik Tok is localized that way where you'll have to use a VPN service like I showed you in order to get your organic
9:41:07
videos to show to that specific uh audience in that specific region second thing on Facebook you noticed that I
9:41:13
added the link in the uh description of the video but it is going to be kind of similar to Tik Tok um usually when you
9:41:19
watch a real the links are not clickable so it's going to be that way on Facebook too even though I am hoping that some
9:41:25
people who do watch the video will be on their PC not on mobile and it'll be easier to uh copy and paste the link
9:41:30
onto their browsers in any case most of them are going to go to our main page they're going to click on Prime jungle
9:41:37
in the real and they're going to go to our front page here so that is why I want to have the link to that product
9:41:43
right here from the pro post that I just made and of course I've got the link in BIO here as well uh it should also be
9:41:50
here in the uh about us page so you've got the uh link to the store and uh that
9:41:55
way they can also get to the product so we're hoping that our viewers are going to be just kind of smart and know how to
9:42:01
navigate their way from the re to our link whether it's in the bio whe whether it's in the post or whether it's on the
9:42:09
main page where it's linked right here okay so we can see that the real has already been posted we can see it right
9:42:14
here uh overall it looks really good uh very much fitting the uh short video format also uh whether it's on Tik Tok
9:42:21
or Facebook or anywhere else we'd want to post it so I've got the notification here your uploaded videos ready to view
9:42:27
okay so that's it it's out there um on Facebook I was not able to schedule the video so that makes Tik Tok a little bit
9:42:34
better in that sense but uh again this is showing worldwide and yeah so now I'm going to do the same for the rest of the
9:42:39
videos I'm going to upload the rest of the reals right here so you get the point on how to do that so you want to keep your Facebook page active you want
9:42:46
to keep uploading posts and of course keep uploading short videos uh as reals even if it doesn't work in one week you
9:42:52
can try it again the next week the audience gets refreshed and you could find some that resonate with it that will get the algorithm to work in your
9:42:58
favor and of course try out more copies more creatives more hooks as I already suggested so this is how we do it on
9:43:05
Facebook and this is how we do it on Tik Tok as you saw I've got my scheduled posts and last but not least we've also
9:43:12
got YouTube so creating a YouTube account just like the other platforms is easy it's free and on YouTube you don't
9:43:18
need to use any VPN so here we are just going to make the regular changes so first we're going to click on customize
9:43:24
Channel and get our page up and ready so first we've got the banner image I'm going to click on upload go to the main
9:43:30
folder where we saved everything and this is the header image and as you can see it's aligned so so perfectly that I
9:43:38
don't even need to touch anything and that is why I love canvas so much all right so we're going to click on done
9:43:44
and we've got the profile image going to use the same one that we've been using in other places and
9:43:51
also looks really good centered really well I don't really need to touch it okay the name is prime jungle handle of
9:43:57
course is prime jungle I like this name nobody's using it let's see if this is available as well ah it isn't it isn't
9:44:06
I'm a little bit sad who took that name and didn't take it anywhere else okay so Prime jungle one all right next the
9:44:12
description so similar to what we wrote In other places you can use of course A slogan that you thought of it's good to
9:44:18
have a slogan that's kind of repetitive around all channels so best deals online
9:44:23
actually you know what let's go with what it says in the banner Welcome to the Jungle wild value Untamed quality Welcome to the Jungle World value
9:44:30
Untamed quality and the URL okay and um even though we added the link here we
9:44:35
are definitely going to add it here so the title to the link is prime jungle star and this is the URL and contact
9:44:44
info is prime jungle store gmail.com and we're going to click on publish once we
9:44:49
are done and we want to save the changes give it a quick refresh and there we go
9:44:54
so we are good to go on YouTube as well so this is called the YouTube studio and this is where we can also upload our
9:45:00
content so I'm going to click here on content and here you have the shorts video section and so from here we're
9:45:06
going to go ahead and click on upload videos select files and again start with
9:45:12
the first one so video ads pet steam brush exports start off
9:45:18
with the first copy the only pret brush you'll need this is
9:45:27
the only pret pet brush you'll need okay another description again it's a short
9:45:32
video not a lot of people will be able to see the description but we're going to write it anyway and in order to add URLs here as you can see right here it
9:45:38
says to make external links clickable first complete a onetime verification and you'll notice that you're either
9:45:43
going to have to send them a video verification or send them an ID or have at least two months of Channel History
9:45:49
um so I can do either one of these but I'm not going to do it now cuz I'm in the middle of the recording and I don't want to wait to till tomorrow to uh
9:45:56
finish this so I don't mind if it won't be clickable because in any case if anybody's going to take interest in this
9:46:01
product they usually go to the bio of the page and see what this page is all about and on my YouTube bio of course
9:46:08
the link is clickable okay so you do want to pass the verification so that it will be clickable from here but in my
9:46:15
case it's not going to be sadly but it's okay um in any case I'm really hoping that Tik Tok is going to to do the work
9:46:21
for me because Tik Tok is much much better when it comes to short videos and organic but because you're building your
9:46:26
brand I want you to be on all social media channels and this is how you do it right okay so get yours with fast and
9:46:34
free shipping and you we really don't need a thumbnail it's a short video and
9:46:39
it's not made for kids doesn't have a paid promotion doesn't have altered content I don't
9:46:45
mind you doing automatic chapters and tags is also good to have so I'm just going to add some tags grooming brush
9:46:51
cat lovers dog lovers again this is just for SEO for uh search engine
9:46:56
optimization just to hopefully get more viewers pets and Pet Care okay and
9:47:03
everything else we don't really need to uh touch it we're pretty much ready uh the category is not people in blogs it's
9:47:09
more about pets and animals I don't mind having uh comments on how many viewers like the video yep we're pretty much
9:47:15
good to go so I'm just going to go ahead and click on next you have the URL to the short here but first let's publish
9:47:21
it okay so here we don't need to add any related video we don't really have any at the moment uh copyright checks no issues found click on next and
9:47:28
visibility we do want to go public so I'm just going to go public right now post the video so let's go ahead and
9:47:33
click on publish okay we got the URL right here it's already been published if I click
9:47:39
on it it'll take me to the short video on YouTube I can't believe nobody told me about this a threein one steam brush
9:47:46
that Combs masses people like it they're going to click here my cats love it
9:47:51
and here they got the URL to the store okay that's where they're going to find the product now I will have to change
9:47:58
this URL to the category that will only have uh those two products because if they do click on it and once I add more
9:48:04
products they're just going to see a whole bunch of products when they click on uh the main website URL as I explained to you guys so we are going to
9:48:11
have to put it on slash collections slash trending okay so we're going to do that through the uh YouTube studio so
9:48:18
let's do that now this is the page let me just refresh it all right so you're going to click here on the top right and you're going to click on YouTube studio
9:48:23
for every time you want to make changes on your channel and also see the analytics of how your videos perform so far oh my God I got zero views I cannot
9:48:30
believe it I'm just kidding it was just posted okay and so from here we're going to click on
9:48:35
customization and this is the URL that we want to change publish okay so that's it for
9:48:42
YouTube so of course I'm going to upload the rest of the videos uh you understand how to do that so you don't need to see
9:48:47
me doing it I just want to make sure that you guys understand how to do every step step and all of the rinse and repeat that's on me okay so we really
9:48:54
quickly created our YouTube account uploaded all the right informations and all the right places and we started
9:49:00
uploading our short video content for organic marketing same thing for Tik Tok
9:49:05
same thing for Facebook and Instagram didn't really work for us it's kind of bugged at the moment so that's kind of
9:49:10
their loss but of course you're going to do Instagram as well and you can also add in others like Pinterest but these
9:49:16
are the main social media channels that you want to go with that will get your organic traffic and these are the videos
9:49:21
where you want to upload all of these short videos slre SL whatever those platforms call it so if we go back to
9:49:27
the cheat sheet we can see that we did all of the following we created the short form video content we created
9:49:32
multiple creatives and hooks we got examples from our successful competitors we did it by ourselves using both the
9:49:38
Vinci resolve and cap cut both from the free versions cap cut more beginner
9:49:44
friendly The Venture resolve is more advanced with more features but it will never ask you for money where cap cut
9:49:49
will block out some features if you don't pay them anything but both can definitely get the job done as you guys
9:49:54
saw in this video the paid version is going to fivr ugc creators and not doing any editing by yourself we created a Tik
9:50:01
Tok account a Facebook page a YouTube account Instagram didn't really work out we added our product page store URL in
9:50:06
the bio of each social media account we posted the videos on the social media Channels with engaging text and the
9:50:12
engaged viewers will now click on the call to action enter our shop page to purchase the product and so now the next
9:50:17
thing that we are going to do is move over to the paid ads I'm going to have to give this a couple of days see how
9:50:23
the organic content is performing of course I need to upload the rest of the organic content and after a couple days I will see what is getting more traffic
9:50:30
if I'm even getting any sales through this organic method and I'll know which videos I would like to double down on
9:50:35
and put a budget and start paid marketing and of course I'm going to do that with you so that you can see every
9:50:42
step of the way how to do that as well one more quick thing that I want to add is while I was recording the videos I
9:50:48
also took some images of these products just so that I can replace the images that I got from my supplier which I
9:50:54
don't really like so I'm going to mainly switch over I think the images that have a lot of texts I don't really uh like
9:51:01
that maybe I'll just add the images on top maybe I'll remove some of these but it's going to be really easy to do I
9:51:07
already moved them inside their respective uh folders so for example I've got the uh video ads pet team brush
9:51:13
and you can see that I got the images here so this is going to be really easy so I'm going to do that through autods
9:51:19
where it's just automated much easier so like let's say we're going to go for this product first so these are the products that I got from my supplier I'm
9:51:25
going to click on ADD image I can add an image URL if I'm taking from another website but in this case it's from my hard drive and we are now on alarm door
9:51:33
stopper and these are the new images that I took so I'm just going to upload them and this is how you're going to get
9:51:38
more images especially if you already ordered the product to your house to your address or even if you're sending
9:51:43
it to uh a ugc content creator okay and as you see all of the images uh are
9:51:48
being uploaded have been uploaded and now I can use one of these as the main image or I can just continue with what
9:51:54
my supplier sent me or I can uh remove the ones that I don't like like maybe this one here with all the text even
9:52:01
though it does have a step byep on how to use it I may keep them but I will also uh but I've also added these and uh
9:52:07
we'll see which one I'll use for the uh main image I might do some uh AB testing here to see which one will work the best
9:52:13
in any case it's as easy as hovering over it and clicking on Save main image in any case right now I'm just going to save this upload and I'm going to do the
9:52:19
same for the other product of course so I'm going to go back open ferace Trio and add these images as well so images
9:52:26
add
9:52:32
image and add the rest of the images okay now that all the images have been
9:52:37
added you can now see how easy that is to get that done we can do all the rearranging later and uh choose which
9:52:43
ones uh we're going to go with later as the main images and see which ones we're going to remove but for now I just want
9:52:48
to make sure that everything is here everything is is ready and prepared so that when people actually start clicking on our store links they are going to get
9:52:55
to our product pages and see all of the updated images as well all right so what's left for me to do next is to
9:53:01
upload more products to each category so I'm going to have two categories for now one is home security and the other is
9:53:08
pet supplies and I'm going to add more similar products to each very simply by going to autods and I'm going to use the
9:53:15
marketplace for this just going to the pets Niche and here I will add more pet related products prodcts so it's as easy
9:53:22
as choosing any trending product from here I will go with uh private suppliers because I prefer them more than I prefer
9:53:29
retailers it's just better products uh the automation is better for the orders which we will also get to soon and yeah
9:53:37
they also ship relatively quick and we also have customizable branding which I think is just absolutely amazing so I'm
9:53:42
going to go with this product for example I already know what it is I understand it and I think that it will
9:53:48
work well in the store also so I'm going to click here on import draft and while it's going to be in the drafts of course
9:53:54
I'm going to put it in its respectful category so that is one product I like this little cat cave as well so let's
9:53:59
also add this one and let's continue this one I also have this one actually this is a really really cool um ball
9:54:06
that kind of moves by itself with a rechargeable battery so I'm going to add that one as well and well here's the one
9:54:13
that we're already selling so let's continue and let's also add this cat
9:54:18
hammock right here okay so now if I go to the drafts page we can see the products that I just added from the
9:54:23
marketplace again really quickly I didn't have to put that much effort here let me just remove these two because
9:54:29
they were just testing and this is how you make bulk edits by the way so I selected two products then I'm going to
9:54:34
click here on remove from list and that way I don't have to do it one by one and this one as well so click on this remove
9:54:41
okay so let's say I'm going to go with uh this one first so of course I'm going to remake the title remake the description using AI as I showed you
9:54:48
with the optimized title and description with a I and I can see that I have a lot of variants right here lots of different
9:54:54
variations with different colors for the uh hammock which is also really cool so I'm just going to have to uh go through
9:54:59
the uh pricing and make sure that everything here uh is on point and we can have that automated for us if in
9:55:05
advance we go to the settings and we set our pricing for the Lister so that when we list products it'll have some default
9:55:11
setting which again I'm going to go through all of autod DS's settings soon so that you guys can see how that is done but I'm going to do the uh hard
9:55:16
labor for now and of course under collections we are going to choose The Collection SL the category that belongs
9:55:22
to because that's why we're adding these products in the first place to fill up the categories okay so first one is done
9:55:28
I'm just going to click on Save but I'm not importing it yet to my store it's not going to go be live yet because I still want to do the title description
9:55:35
and the pricing for the variations but you get the point now on how to get these categories filled up really
9:55:41
quickly and get more trending pet products on our website and now I will also be able to use the frequently
9:55:47
bought together app if you remember when we went through the best Shopify apps and I will be able to add those products
9:55:52
as frequently bought together with this ferus Trio product and that way hopefully I will get a much larger
9:55:58
average order card value when more people are going to add these frequently bought together products to their cards
9:56:05
so everything is starting to come together and I'm more than excited to start taking the next steps on the store
9:56:10
it's getting more exciting it's getting more fun it's getting more addicting you can see all the Shopify apps here the sticky ad to cart the live chat and
9:56:17
everything else that we did here and like I said it's all starting to come together so I'm going to finish up
9:56:22
uploading the rest of the videos on all my social media channels I'm going to finish up filling in the categories with more products you know how to do all of
9:56:28
that by watching this section and I will see you in a few when I get my organic video results we will analyze it we will
9:56:35
dissect it we will see what worked and then we're going to move over to the paid marketing exciting and I'll see you
9:56:41
there all right so my organic videos have been running for a few days now I would like to show you guys the results
9:56:46
and then we're going to go ahead and jump into PPC paper click marketing and take it one step further this is when
9:56:53
the real marketing the real traffic is going to come in and hopefully we'll be able to make a nice amount of sales and profit but one second before I jump into
9:57:01
that I want to show you some extras that I added to our Prime jungle store so
9:57:06
this is the front page you're pretty much used to seeing all of this by now there's a couple of new things so one I
9:57:12
created a category called all products and another link called categories I'll show you that in a minute but as I
9:57:18
scroll down you can see that this featured product has changed to our top picks our best recommendations grab them
9:57:25
while you can and we've got the two products here the alarm door stopper and the pet steam brush as we scroll down we
9:57:33
are seeing more categories so one is called pet supplies browser hard of selection for your furry friends and
9:57:39
we've got pet supply products here and we've got another category called home security and we've got more home
9:57:46
security products here so the reason that I did this as I explained is because we need to have more products on
9:57:51
our website we cannot have one website with only two products we're not creating a one or two product store so
9:57:56
that is why I added all of these categories and I'll show you exactly how to do that and together we're going to
9:58:02
create another category right now just so that you guys can see how easy it is to get it done and to add it to the
9:58:08
front page of our website and with that we're going to have this all products link so that will just randomly throw
9:58:14
all of the products that we have on the website it's not the most attractive page but it does show that this has a
9:58:20
lot of things to sell and if we click on categories then we can actually see the collections that we made so we already
9:58:27
went through how to create these collections now I just added it as another page through our navigation menu
9:58:34
so I'm going to show you how to do all of that and we're also going to add another category right now so let me
9:58:40
show you how easy it is to get that done we're just going to add one category see the Simplicity of it and then now that
9:58:46
our stores will look really good really ready to sell we're going to begin payperclick marketing all right so let's
9:58:52
go ahead and jump to it so let's create a new category really quick to do that
9:58:58
we're simply going to go to the autods marketplace it's just really easy to get things done from here and also really
9:59:03
easy to get these trending products and let's think of a new category to add so
9:59:09
we already have pet supplies and home security and that is because those are the niches of the two products that we
9:59:15
went with but let's go now with a niche that's not related to those two products
9:59:20
now I already created an electronics and gadgets Niche I just need to link it
9:59:26
right here to our front page so I'm going to show you how to do that but I also want to show you how easy it is to import these products and create a new
9:59:33
category with it so if I go to the products page on autods we can see that I have 48 products listed on this store
9:59:40
and all of the titles all the descriptions got Rewritten by AI so it's really easy to just get them all out
9:59:45
there optimized and ready to sell and you can see that many of these products are actually those Gadget products so
9:59:51
what I need to do is I'm going to take all of those products that I added as gadgets and add them to the gadgets
9:59:58
category to the gadgets collection so in order to do that I'm just going to select all of the products that we have here and I'm going to move on to the
10:00:04
second page and I'm going to stop where I stopped adding the gadgets so that is until here because after this mouse pad
10:00:12
we are starting to look at the first the second set of products that I added which is the door locks okay so let me
10:00:17
just add the rest of these Gadget products right here so I'm just going to click on them as well Okay so we've got
10:00:24
27 Gadget products so after you add them to your store you're going to create a bulk edit right here add item to edit is
10:00:31
going to be a collection because we want to add it to a collection and here we're going to add it to the gadgets and
10:00:37
electronics collection if you don't have a collection that you want you're just going to type the name right here and it's going to create that new collection
10:00:44
but I already created it so I'm just going to click on it and make sure that we add them them to that category so I'm
10:00:51
going to click here on update and now all of those 27 products are going to be updated with the new collection now of
10:00:57
course you can make a bunch of other bulk edits like for example I can grab all those products click on bulk edit
10:01:05
and let's say I want to price them all with the uh Price Slasher so I can click
10:01:10
on compare price or let's say I want to round the cents to 097 make sure that
10:01:15
they all have 097 cents at the end of the price so I'm going to choose that and that's how easy it is to make bulk
10:01:22
changes through autods and save just a whole bunch of time instead of doing it manually so you can see as I speak that
10:01:28
these bulk changes are being done I can click on view details here and see that the products are one by one being
10:01:34
completed with the bulk changes that we made to add them all to the electronics and gadgets category or collection okay
10:01:41
so once that is finished we can make additional bulk changes so let me grab those Gadget products again and we can
10:01:48
even make it easier so in order to grab all those Gadget products let me just refresh this page so now I'm going to
10:01:55
let's say I want to see how all of the gadget products are performing on my store I'm going to click here on ADD
10:02:00
filter and I'm going to add a filter for collections because I only want to see gadgets and electronic so I'm going to
10:02:07
click on done and now you can see all of the gadgets and electronic products that we have we saw 27 products so that is
10:02:13
exactly what we're seeing here so let me go ahead and grab all of them in bulk and let's make another bulk edit so the
10:02:21
next thing that I want to do is I want to make sure that they all have round sents and I want to round all of their
10:02:27
prices to .97 cents just so that it'll all look nice and organized and the last
10:02:33
thing that I'm going to do is add gadgets and electronics to our homepage because now we have another Niche so
10:02:40
we're going to go to the Shopify dashboard and then on the Shopify dashboard what we're going to do is move
10:02:45
over to the online store and we're going to customize the thing theme and from the theme this is where we customize the
10:02:52
homepage as you guys are already well aware of so here we've got all of the featured collections that I added so the
10:02:58
only thing that I did was I just added another section over here under template so we've got the header we're not going to touch anything that's around the
10:03:04
header we move down to the template which is where we have all of these sections these columns right here and
10:03:10
then we have the footer section which we're not going to touch right now okay so back to the template these are the four collections that I added so the
10:03:16
first one is Art top picks and then pet supplies and home security and then as you guys and that one well I had a blank
10:03:24
featured collection cuz that's the one that I wanted to show you how to do so I just deleted it but if I click now here
10:03:29
on ADD section then here I can say okay this is the type of section that I want to add you can add a collection a
10:03:35
featured product a collection list or just add text or image with text image Banner you can get fancy with these
10:03:41
things later on but right now we just want to add that collection so I'm going to click here on featured collection
10:03:46
okay you can see that it was added here although it was added be below the image Banner so I do just want to drag it up a
10:03:52
bit right below the previous featured collection which was the home security
10:03:58
so this one is called gadgets and electronics so here on the right side while I'm clicking on this featured
10:04:03
collection on the right side I'm going to change the name for the heading so it's going to be gadgets and electronics
10:04:11
and the description we're just going to uh write something really quick so a nice little sentence to connect to the
10:04:18
viewers check out our latest and greatest
10:04:24
selection of life hacks gadgets and electronics for everyday use okay just
10:04:32
make sure that it's all in one sentence doesn't skip a line okay great looks good so the only thing that's missing
10:04:37
here is of course the products okay so we're going to continue scrolling down and here it says collection select
10:04:44
collection so here we're going to select collection remember that collection is another word for category on Shopify and
10:04:50
now we're going to choose the gadgets and electronics okay now you can see that the products are loading up and
10:04:55
then we're going to click here on the bottom right on select okay so nice and easy we're going to click on Save and if
10:05:01
you notice that you have this issue where the text is not aligned well like right here you can see that here it's
10:05:07
aligned well and then here it's kind of going up a bit and then here it's going back down so what we're going to do is
10:05:12
we're going to again click on the featured collection that we're working on right now and here under image ratio
10:05:18
go ahead and click on on portrait now you can see that everything is aligned pretty well and that's it we don't really need to touch anything else
10:05:24
unless you want to change some of these settings here like the amount of columns but it's pretty good as is we only need
10:05:30
to touch what's relevant and that we already did and that's it I saved it now let's go and see what it looks like on
10:05:36
our website so Prime jungle. store and it should be here on the front page so let's just scroll down and here it is
10:05:43
gadgets and electronics okay so that's how easy it is to add new categories to
10:05:48
your website and make sure that your viewer can see it on the front page next if we click here on categories we can
10:05:55
see that gadgets and electronics was added here as well now the images here are pretty much being randomized by the
10:06:01
products that we have inside these categories but that is perfectly fine with me and another change that I made
10:06:07
is on the colors of the buttons so you guys may notice that it's more green than it was black in the previous video
10:06:14
so that is another quick edit that I made and that's just to get them more into our brand colors which is more of a
10:06:21
greenish because of the Jungle and that's why I made the buttons like that as well so doing that was relatively
10:06:27
easy I just clicked here on theme settings of course we're still under the online store theme customization and
10:06:33
then here we've got colors so I clicked on colors and then I clicked on the first one and I just changed the solid
10:06:40
button background from black to this green and that's it it just pretty much changed all of the colors of the buttons
10:06:46
and this is the scheme that we are going to go with all right so let's quickly add just one more category I just want
10:06:52
you to see how easy it is to add these products optimize them get them ready to sell and add them to the front page
10:06:58
which we just did but here's how easy it is to find those products in the first place so let's go back to the marketplace on autods and again this is
10:07:05
how we're easily filling up our store with more products and then later we can also test them when it comes to organic marketing paid marketing and everything
10:07:11
else so we already know that all these products are good and trending let's choose another category and you don't
10:07:17
have to copy and paste the category from here you you can even dig down to a further sub Niche like for example you
10:07:23
can go with a broad home in Garden or choose something under home in Garden like for example kitchen and dining this
10:07:31
can be a great Niche so I'm going to click here on kitchen and dining it's a great great category for drop shippers
10:07:37
and I'm just going to go ahead and add this one as well so first let's go ahead and add these products to our stores
10:07:43
okay so let's choose the next set of trending products from the marketplace this time in the home and kitchen Niche
10:07:48
and we're just going to create that cat atory on autods and Shopify as well okay so first thing we need to do is just
10:07:54
grab some trending products here so whether you want to use uh retailers or private suppliers I'm going to go with
10:08:00
private suppliers because it's always better to work with them and here we are under the home and kitchen Niche so I'm
10:08:06
going to choose some products here that uh look good look they're all trending these private suppliers know what products to sell but we're also going to
10:08:12
choose whatever looks good what has nice images and of course products that look interesting that's hard to find in local
10:08:17
stores all right so it's as easy as we know as hovering over the product and clicking on import draft just keep in
10:08:24
mind the shipping time make sure that it doesn't exceed our shipping policies which is up to 2 weeks which is fine and
10:08:30
we should be eligible with all of the products that we're seeing here but just make sure that you're looking at these things and also make sure that your
10:08:36
ships to is looking at the country that you are shipping to which in our case is the United States so this is fine you
10:08:42
can also select your ships from so if you want to ship really quickly for example from into the us we're going to choose us from ships from in my case
10:08:49
it's doesn't matter I can also ship from uh uh Chinese suppliers I don't mind if they're Chinese or us as long as they
10:08:54
ship within less than 2 weeks to our customers one week of course one week and less is always the optimal shipping
10:09:00
time that we are going to look for so let's go ahead this manual vegetable chopper right here looks good nice item
10:09:07
nice little multitool right here shipping time one one and A2 weeks I'm going to go ahead and add that by
10:09:12
clicking on import draft and I'm just going to add a whole bunch of products with this technique so another one right
10:09:17
here I like this electric coffee grinder I'm going to add that as well um these Stanley Cups I'm not so sure about them
10:09:24
I'm going to continue glass sailing wine bottle this is a really cool looking product I'm going to add that as well
10:09:31
and these Tumblr cups actually look pretty cool let's add them this wine product also looks really nice and what
10:09:37
are we looking at here nice so this is a spoon but it's also a kitchen skill I haven't seen that before let's go ahead
10:09:43
and add that portable juice blender I've seen a few of these but this does have a unique design let's go ahead and add
10:09:49
that um I don't like all the text here so I'm just going to not go for that product right there these are products
10:09:56
that we're adding quickly we're not going to go inside and start editing the images and all of that we just want to fill up our store with more goodlook
10:10:01
products and these products sell along the way and later when we're done working on our current products we could
10:10:07
look at these products for the next for organic and PPC as well okay so I added this portable mini washing machine this
10:10:14
self stirring coffee mug let's add that as well and scroll down a bit we're just going to add a few more portable washing
10:10:21
machine is a great product too so let's add that we've already got some tumblers so let's continue uh these are just
10:10:28
regular looking cups and mugs so I'm looking for something that's a little bit more special another type of juice
10:10:34
blender let's go ahead and add them as well and you can see that they have variations just from the price ranges so that is great and let's see anti-gravity
10:10:41
humidifier also really cool product and it also has a clock let's add that and
10:10:47
continue to scroll so you can see that there's a lot of products that we can sell here and all the product research
10:10:52
has already been done for us so it's really really easy to just jump into a niche that we like and start choosing
10:10:58
the products to sell on our stores so let's just do a little bit more of Doom scrolling because there are so so many
10:11:04
products to go over and so many different types of private suppliers that we can work with so this is all for
10:11:10
Halloween I'm not going to add it now because once Halloween ends it's not these products are not going to be relevant anymore and I would only want
10:11:16
to start a couple months before the event and not not just right before the event so this private supplier added a
10:11:22
lot of Halloween products so we're just going to scroll past that okay let's see
10:11:27
what else these vegetable cleaners let's add that as well and let's just add a couple of more products so let's go with
10:11:34
this coffee mug warmer this vacuum sealer roll and this cool fried egg pan
10:11:42
and okay that's enough so all of these products have been added to our stores but they're still drafts they we still
10:11:47
need to optimize them before moving them to the product section where they are actually live and we'll be able to
10:11:53
connect them to a category and link to it from our front page on our website so I clicked on the drafts and here of
10:11:59
course we can see all of these products that we just added from the marketplace under the kitchen and dining Niche so
10:12:05
what I'm going to do here is just remove whatever is not relevant I don't know how this mobile phone led selfie ring light got here probably when I was just
10:12:12
testing some things so let's just remove that I'm going to click on these three dots and delete draft everything else is
10:12:17
relevant so what we're going to do now is I'm going to bulk select these products and we are going to do a bulk
10:12:24
edit whereas the first one is going to be the collection and we're going to add a new collection so this is kitchen and
10:12:31
dining so let's call it kitchen and dining and we're going to click right
10:12:36
here so it's going to add that new collection since we don't have it and we are going to click on update so now it's
10:12:43
creating that collection on our store and it's going to put all of those products it's going to assign them to
10:12:48
the kitchen and dining collection SL category okay so that just took a couple of seconds now that that's done let's
10:12:55
click again on all of these products and we're going to make a few more bulk edits so one is going to be the pricing
10:13:03
sense rounder so we're going to click on round sense
10:13:09
2.97 and when we get to the one of the last sections of this video I'm going to go through all of autod DS's settings so
10:13:16
that you guys will be able to set your list settings so every time you're listing a product it's going to have all
10:13:21
of the default options that you guys are looking for for example rounding sense to 97
10:13:26
9989 whatever you want uh price monitoring stock monitoring and having all of the Automation in advance so you
10:13:33
won't really need to make the changes after you add the products to your stores but because I haven't gotten to that yet I'm showing you how to do it
10:13:40
after but there is more than one way of doing the things that you want to do on autods so it really doesn't matter which
10:13:45
method you choose to go with okay so those bulk changes were created as well and there is one last update that we
10:13:52
want to make before adding these products to our Shopify stores and that is the bulk AI rewrite tool so I'm going
10:13:58
to grab all these products again in bulk and I'm going to click here on bulk AI rewrite I'm going to go with title and
10:14:04
description and I'm going to keep everything as is I want it to sound professional and balanced let's click on
10:14:09
AI rewrite and let the system do its magic so now my titles are going to be
10:14:15
optimized my descriptions are going to be optimized I added it to my collection I rounded up my pricing sense value and
10:14:21
you can make more changes but I think that that is more than enough just to have another category with trending products on our stores all in less than
10:14:28
5 minutes okay so here we are the bulk changes are being made as we speak we can see the counter right here you can
10:14:34
click on view details to see what is the current status what is done and what is left to be done but overall we can see
10:14:41
the new titles are being successful but as we can see the new titles are being successfully added you can see here that
10:14:47
they're all successful we don't have any felt products and that is pretty much it so once that is being done we just have
10:14:53
a few more to go we can go to our Shopify dashboard and start working on
10:14:58
this category so here we are again under the uh theme settings so again we're under online star and then we clicked on
10:15:05
customize over here and now we're going to create that new collection okay so we're going to click again here under
10:15:12
template we're going to click on ADD section I'm going to move a little bit faster because you guys already saw me doing this so it's going to be called featured collection then we're going to
10:15:19
drag it up below the previous one and on the right side we're going to rename it to kitchen and dining we're going to
10:15:27
write a nice little sentence here the kitchen is the heart of the home make it
10:15:32
a big Ving heart with these fine products okay then I'm going to select
10:15:38
the collection The Collection is kitchen and dining which should have been created here it is so we're going to
10:15:43
click on kitchen and dining and click on select okay now I'm just going to make sure that everything everything is
10:15:49
aligned well so I'm going to change the image ratio to Portrait and I'm going to click on Save now you guys may have
10:15:55
noticed that the products here are still these General t-shirts that we're not really selling on our stores so how come
10:16:01
the products did not load up yet I want to see if anyone is able to think about this before I give you the answer so how
10:16:07
come here we got the products after we selected the right collection right kitchen and dining but the products didn't load up all right well the answer
10:16:13
to that is because they're all still on our drafts page so we need to import them to the products page page once we
10:16:19
import them they'll be live on our stores as long as they're not live on our stores Shopify doesn't even know that these products exist so I'm just
10:16:25
going to grab all of these products from the draft so we're going to make a bul grab make sure it's all grabbed and we are going to click on import all right
10:16:32
here yes I'm sure okay and then and now in a few seconds all of these products
10:16:37
will be imported to the products section of our stores which means that they are all live along with the rest of these
10:16:42
products here okay and we can see here how quick it's being added to our stores and we
10:16:48
are done okay so everything moved successfully from the drafts to the product section of our stores which means that we should start seeing those
10:16:54
products on our front page instead of that General t-shirts so let's refresh this page right here and see if now we
10:17:00
got the products instead of the shirts scroll down and here we are so
10:17:07
the only thing that was missing is of course moving the products from drafts to products where now they are actually live on our stores okay so this has
10:17:13
already been saved on our front page we can go ahead and refresh our website scroll scroll
10:17:19
down and that's it I added this along with you guys you can see that the round sense feature works so we got 38.97 2297
10:17:27
we've got the images we've got the titles and descriptions which have been Rewritten with the help of artificial
10:17:34
intelligence and you can see here how well everything went through we didn't really have to do much besides just
10:17:39
click one button and all of the variations went through as well so easy peasy now we have another nice niche and
10:17:47
if I click here on categories you can see that kitchen and dining was added automatically as well so how was I able
10:17:53
to create this categories page let me show you really quick and then we're going to move on to paid marketing so back on the Shopify dashboard this time
10:18:00
we're going to the navigation menu and here we made a change on the header and I also moved one link to the footer that
10:18:07
is the r story link and that's just simply because I ran out of room here it was making another line over here and I
10:18:13
only wanted to have one line so I moved our story to the bottom lots of big websites have that section there on the
10:18:19
bottom so I feel okay with it and here on the main menu I'm going to click on that under the navigation under online
10:18:25
store you've got the products so I just changed your name to all products and
10:18:31
then here there's another one so I just clicked on ADD menu item and I wrote its name so categories and then I clicked to
10:18:37
see the drop down on what I wanted to link to so in other words let's just go ahead and edit that you can see that I
10:18:42
named it categories and here I clicked on collections so then it's like okay I
10:18:48
want you to show a category now Shopify is asking me which category do you want a specific category and I'm like no I
10:18:53
want all categories so I clicked on all collections and of course you could do it differently you could write here
10:18:59
instead of categories gadgets and electronics and then link only under collections to gadgets and electronics
10:19:05
but then I'm going to have a link to every category up here and it's going to get too scattered I'm going to have too many Links of course another way to do
10:19:11
it is to add a drop down so you can when you hover over categories you'll see the categories and you hover over the next one but you're going to need more
10:19:18
add-ons for and you really don't need it just to start off so this is how simple it is to get all of that done and of
10:19:23
course under products the link is to all products so if I click on all products it links to all products instead of a
10:19:30
specific product right so you can click on products you can link to a specific product but of course here we're going with all products okay so now that our
10:19:37
store is full looks good let's go ahead and begin with paid marketing we're ready to drive traffic to this bad boy
10:19:44
and start making our sales and profit look how simple it was to get a nice
10:19:49
store up and running I know it's been really long because I made it super technical and we still got a ways to go
10:19:55
especially when it comes to marketing and everything that's going to come after fulfilling orders and taking the next steps into building and scaling our
10:20:02
businesses but just look at how we got a store up and running looks good looks like a wellestablished brand it's got
10:20:09
products inside everything is set up and good to go so now let's make it to the next part and see how well our organic
10:20:16
videos performed and which ones we are going to move move forward to paid marketing and create our campaigns all
10:20:21
right before I move on to show you the organic video results and start the PBC campaigns there's just a couple of more tips that I want to give out to you so
10:20:28
the first one is I noticed that on the product page for fman trio the pet hair steam brush that the wrong image is
10:20:36
being used as the main image and I did clarify on autods what I want the main
10:20:41
image to be and Shopify did see that so let me just show you really quick so you open up the product uh editing page on
10:20:47
autods and you move over to the images tab and here I set my main image which
10:20:53
is the image that I took using my camera and you can see that it's the main image here on autods and when I go to Shopify
10:21:00
and I open up the product page for this you can see that that is what the system chose because that's what I chose on
10:21:05
autod DS so when I open up the product page why am I still seeing this
10:21:10
variation this blue variation as the main image and the reason for that is because the variation the first
10:21:17
variation that shows up is not the one that I want it's this blue variation which you can see right here it's called
10:21:23
Blue well and that is the first variation that Shopify just randomly adds into the order of these variations
10:21:29
so the one that I want is actually this one the coffee handle which uses this one as the main image so in order to do
10:21:37
that we open up the product page again on Shopify and here we open up the variant section right here so if you
10:21:43
click on it you can drag and drop wherever you want the right variation to
10:21:49
be in first place so in my case it's coffee handle so I already place it all the way up here and I'm going to go
10:21:55
ahead and click on done and once that is saved now when I refresh this page it's
10:22:01
not going to show the blue variation as the first one the coffee will be the first one and now you will see what is
10:22:07
going to be the main image once I refresh and now we can see the right variation is here in first place so
10:22:13
first is the coffee handle then the white handle and then the rest as we can see so you can set the order right here
10:22:18
in the variant section on Shopify but you can see that this is the image
10:22:23
that's being used for the variation so we're not seeing this as the main image what we're actually seeing is this one
10:22:29
and that's because that is the picture of the variant but if we go to the categories and we look at the product
10:22:35
here on our Shopify store so here for example it's pet supplies and we're
10:22:40
going to look for that product so here it is so you can see what the main image is so that is what we're going to see on
10:22:45
our store but the main image is going to be the variant image so here you can change that on autods so I can just
10:22:52
click on the product click on the variation that I want to change which is this one the coffee handle one and here
10:22:57
you can change the image for the variation so I can click on change image and I can say that this is what I want
10:23:03
the variations image to be then I'm going to click on Save okay and that is going to be saved as well so that is
10:23:08
another quick tip and the other one that I want to give you right before we finally jump into the action is remember
10:23:14
how I told you that we also added a frequently bought together app and I I told you that I'm only going to enable
10:23:19
it after we add more products to the store well now that we have more products let's go ahead and add that app
10:23:25
add frequently bought together to the two products the alert Guard Pro to the fmus trio then I will show you the
10:23:31
results of the organic marketing and we'll move on to paid marketing I know that you've been waiting for it but I
10:23:36
want you to have all of the perks and benefits before you get started with marketing where the real action is going
10:23:41
to start okay so let's go back to the Shopify dashboard and here we're going to look for that app so I'm going to
10:23:47
click on app and here it is it's called essential upsell so I'm going to click on it okay and now we're going to create
10:23:52
our first offer so I'm going to click on create offer and what we want is for it to be on the product page you can also
10:23:57
make an offer on the C page but I'm going to do it on the product page and then here the offer type I'm going to
10:24:02
choose frequently bought together okay and as you can see it opens up a couple more options if we go for a cross sale
10:24:08
it just says hey you know what you may also like this product and then they could buy that one instead but I want them to buy the main product that
10:24:14
they're looking for plus additional product so that's what frequently bot together is going to help us do the offer name you can rename it if you want
10:24:20
the customer is not going to see it and the content what do you want it to say up here I I can keep frequently bought
10:24:26
together you can also go with uh customers also uh bot or whatever you
10:24:31
want it really doesn't matter that much as long as the customer understands what this means what this is so you can also
10:24:38
go with other customers also liked okay but again I'm just going to keep it as
10:24:44
is even Amazon uses uh frequently bought together as their text okay then you got the button text right here so claim
10:24:51
offer I'm going to leave it at that I'm going to leave it on claim offer and I am going to give them an offer for
10:24:56
adding more products to the card so I'll show you where that is now we're going to click here on continue to offer okay
10:25:01
and now it's asking me okay what product you want to do this on so I don't want to do it on all products of my store I only want to do it on specific products
10:25:07
and the first one is alert guard so let's just make the quick search here it is we're going to click on select okay
10:25:14
so this is the product that you're going to add the offer on and what is a frequently bought together offer that
10:25:19
you want to add so that is down here the offer so the offer is for what products do you want to add now don't choose
10:25:26
frequently bought together because then it's just going to randomly show related products I want to choose which products because I want them to be related to the
10:25:33
main product so here I'm going to search for a specific product and you can click
10:25:39
browse to open up all of your products and search for the product that you want to add so in this case I wanted to be in
10:25:44
the home security uh category so so most of those products are things like um
10:25:51
door lockers or all other types of uh lockers and I can also get a good example of the products names by going
10:25:58
back to autods and on the products page I'm going to add a filter and I only want to see products that are under a
10:26:03
collection called home security okay so click on done and these are all the products that I have so it's not too
10:26:10
much we can easily add more but it's enough for now and I'm just going to add some of these products so they're all
10:26:16
pretty much locked so I'm just going to type the word lock lock and here I can choose what products I want to add to the frequently bot
10:26:22
together okay so one is going to be this uh dual lock right here and the other is going to be let's see stealthy ninja
10:26:30
door lock another type of door lock and the last one is going to be this
10:26:35
fingerprint safe lock right here so I'm going to click on select okay so I selected these three products now I can
10:26:42
choose if I want to give them a discount for adding these products to their cards along with the main product and I want
10:26:47
to do that so I'm going to click on percentage and I'm going to give them another 10% off if they add those
10:26:52
products I don't mind shaving that off of our profits because we're profiting enough anyway and I would rather have it
10:26:57
a higher average order value because we're profiting from percentages and the higher the average order value or the
10:27:03
aov the more profit we'll make from these sales so now I'm going to click on continue to design and here you can set
10:27:10
the colors the borders and stuff like that I'm going to leave everything on default but you can get creative here if
10:27:16
you want the only tip that I can give you here is stay true to your brand colors and design if you decided to go
10:27:23
with certain colors on your website make sure that you're using the same color codes when you're making the changes
10:27:28
here and just make sure that it looks good okay so I'm going to click now on continue to placement and that is pretty
10:27:33
much it so after publishing it's going to be added below the add to card button of the triggered products which is this
10:27:40
triggered product for now so I'm going to go ahead and click on publish and now let's go see what it looks like we can see that the offer was created so let's
10:27:48
go to that product now okay and you can see right here so we got the title as usual we only got one variation here and
10:27:54
right here below the add to card so if the customer clicks on add to cart right here it's going to just add this variation to the card but if you go a
10:28:00
little bit more below you can see the frequently bought together right here so this is what we just created right now
10:28:06
and you can see that if they buy this in all of these products they're going to get that extra 10% discount so they're
10:28:11
getting it on the main product and also on all of the other products and if you
10:28:16
unclick them then you cannot claim the offer right you cannot get 10% only off the main product you have to take at
10:28:23
least one of the other products in order to get 10% on all and this way instead
10:28:29
of them checking out with $37.97 they can check out with about $90 for this transaction and they're
10:28:35
going to get other products that are related to the niche to the product that they just ordered so that is why I want
10:28:41
you to use this app on your stores increase your average order values and remember that this app is absolutely
10:28:47
free I did not pay anything for this and for the sticky ad to card here on the bottom and for all the other apps that I
10:28:53
showed you previously in this video okay so let's just quickly do the frequently
10:28:59
bought together for the firmest Trio and then we can continue forward so again
10:29:04
we're going to choose the frequently bought together continue to offer specific product so the trigger here is
10:29:10
Fus Trio okay so they're going to take the default variation and now we are going to give them three more products
10:29:17
from the pet so I'm just going to search for pet and I'm also going to add let's see I like this cat cave right here and
10:29:25
this self-rolling interactive toy ball is also a bestseller and let's also add this cat hammock okay so I'm going to
10:29:32
click on select and that's it the more you do it the more simple it gets so we're going to give them another 10% if
10:29:38
they choose to increase their average order value click on publish okay and we are
10:29:44
Done Quick Check and we just scroll down okay here it is with the discounts
10:29:52
and everything else so as long as the customer adds one of these variations and adds one of these
10:29:59
frequently bought together products they're going to get the extra 10% okay so that's what we're looking for and the
10:30:04
last thing I want to show you is how to also rearrange the images because you can see that the main image is fine okay
10:30:10
we fixed it we're seeing what we want then we're seeing the images from the suppliers which is okay I'm not going to
10:30:15
delete them but we do have better images Unique Images that I also took specifically for this product so how do
10:30:22
I get these images to be seen first so we're going to go back to the item editor page here on Shopify and now
10:30:28
we're just going to rearrange the images so just like we did it with the variations we're going to do that with the images now so I'm just going to
10:30:34
click here on the plus 23 to see all of the images to make sure that they all load up and I'm just going to play the
10:30:39
drag and drop game so I'm just going to drag all of the images the unique ones
10:30:44
that we took to the top and everything else can stay below
10:30:51
that okay easy peasy lemon squeezy and now everything is saved so we can just
10:30:57
refresh the page and much much better now and I can also guarantee that no other website has
10:31:04
these images because I'm the one who took them okay looking good so now that we have everything down ready to go
10:31:11
we've got frequently bought together we've got the images and variations lined up I am going to drop the price
10:31:16
just a bit in order to increase the chances of making sales right from the start and after I make sales I'm going to slowly increase the price and I can
10:31:23
also add automation to help me do that so I can see that the original Buy price is around $5 I can sell it for around
10:31:29
three times that price easily at $14.99 so let's just make this bul change to all of the variations over here so I'm
10:31:35
just going to bulk select the variations for this product click here on edit and
10:31:41
the sell price here we are going to change it to 14.97 actually not 99 click on update
10:31:48
and that's it they're all now 1497 let's go back to their page on the website and
10:31:54
you can see here 1797 refresh the page okay and there we go 1497 and the same
10:32:01
goes for all of the other variations okay great let's do it let's get to it it's marketing time we did enough let's
10:32:08
go ahead and get to it all right so here are the results of the organic ads or the organic videos that I posted on the
10:32:15
social media accounts that I showed you earlier in this video so I posted on Tik Tok on YouTube and on
10:32:21
Facebook and I also wanted to do other platforms like Instagram Pinterest and so forth but there's only so much that I
10:32:27
can squeeze in into this little little video but when you do it of course use it on all the other social media
10:32:34
accounts that you have so my top three examples and the top three that are leading are those three platforms so Tik
10:32:41
Tok YouTube and Facebook so let's go ahead and see the results of the organic videos that I uploaded to my accounts
10:32:46
first and foremost is is YouTube which actually did an excellent job I wasn't expecting to reach almost 6,000 views in
10:32:54
just a few days and we can see the videos that were uploaded right here and these are the videos the top performers
10:33:00
so we can see the views right here so this video here got 1,800 and this door alarm stopper got 1,22 views and this
10:33:07
variation here of the pet steam brush got 560 530 and so forth and the least
10:33:12
performing video is the one that said did you know get alert Guard Pro and stay safe for you go so let's start with
10:33:19
the least performing one first I think that that happened because you shouldn't really start with a did you know and
10:33:25
it's like okay what am I supposed to know and get alert Guard Pro so right away you're throwing you know you're trying to Market something at them
10:33:31
before even connecting with the viewer and I think that that is what made this video here flop only two views YouTube
10:33:37
understood right away hey this is not what people want to see and the algorithm stopped working for that video
10:33:43
also calling all pet lovers didn't do that good only 63 organic views this this is the grooming brush you didn't
10:33:48
know you need so that one just didn't work and some videos are just going to be flops and that is why I always
10:33:55
recommended to post several videos on the same product and not just one or two because if they don't work you may go
10:34:02
off to thinking that this product is simply not it or you didn't do a good job in the editing but if you would have
10:34:07
tried 10 videos 20 videos that would have made a difference because you would see different results okay so those are
10:34:14
the ones that didn't work that well and the rest did a pretty good job espe if we look at the video that did really
10:34:20
really well so the top two videos and I'm glad to see this are from two different products so the first one is
10:34:27
the pet steam brush and the second one is the door stopper so I'm glad to see that because this means that both
10:34:33
products are pretty interesting third place is the pet brush again fourth place is the pet brush and fifth place
10:34:39
sixth place are the door stoppers so it almost pretty much evens out both of these products are interesting and if I
10:34:45
click on the first one you can see right here we're actually peaking right now so
10:34:50
you can see at how the view rate just started going up and up and every day it's just getting more and more organic
10:34:56
views so of course this is not stopping in the last 48 hours we got over 1,000
10:35:02
views and it's mainly working well on the shorts feed as we can see right here which is great people are seeing it on
10:35:08
their feed and we can see the average view duration here is around 15 seconds so that is about 60% of the video
10:35:15
because the video is 26 seconds long and and this is the video that worked the best so let's just take a look really
10:35:20
quick to remember what video that was and what we had here my cats are in love with this new grooming my cats are in
10:35:27
love with this new grooming brush do you guys remember when I did the editing here and here I used another seller's
10:35:34
video so I started off by using my video right because the hook is really important and you can see that this
10:35:40
video by the way made 61 likes which I think is great the engagement here is absolutely amazing and so again it
10:35:46
started with our hook that we created if you would have used another sell's Hook YouTube the algorithms on YouTube Tik
10:35:52
Tok everywhere else can see right away hey this video already exists we already have this hook so it's not going to work
10:35:58
well with the algorithm now but here that's not what we did we added our own hook it's Unique and then we added other
10:36:03
elements that worked well for other sellers so we really did a kind of all-in-one video when I say we of course
10:36:09
I mean I but because I'm here with you guys I kind of feel like we're all here together so it's a Wii and so that's
10:36:14
what I did here so it's a unique hook and then we moved on to the other sellers video then we came back to our video so let's watch again this is the
10:36:20
winning video and this is the one that I'm going to put the biggest Budget on when I start running paid ads that's
10:36:25
what we use organic for to see what videos will work well now we know what to put our budgets on so let's take a
10:36:31
look my cats are in love with this new grooming brush it's a streamer massager
10:36:37
and hair remover your furry friend will love it so back to my video so easy to
10:36:42
use just add some water my video and show your pets some love my video and
10:36:47
effective for both cats and dogs it's amazing how good this works so of course it's not just Who video which most most
10:36:54
of the content here is my video um it's also the text that you're adding it's also how long each section takes you
10:37:01
just need to keep the viewers attention on your video for as long as possible
10:37:06
get yours now with fast shipping okay and again uh the other sellers video so a nice combination and this one worked
10:37:13
really really well and second place is as we saw let's go back to the channel analytics is the door stopper and here
10:37:20
we're looking at this specific one so I'll show you the video in a second we can see that the views were completely
10:37:26
dead for the first day and a half and suddenly it started to pick up and that's where we're at right now let's
10:37:32
see what video that is so notice this this is without the
10:37:37
text to speech this is not using cap cut this was the video that I made from the Vinci resolve and that is why I stressed
10:37:45
how important it is to test different variations s and they don't all have to have text to speech maybe they don't
10:37:51
even all have to have background music even though this one has but you need to keep testing different angles because
10:37:58
you never know what the results will be you never know what will resonate with the audience this time and it's good to learn all of these different types of
10:38:05
aspects and angles and ways to Market your product so I bought this for my mother who was traveling alone you guys
10:38:11
may remember where I took this example from this sentence let's continue she's no longer afraid of
10:38:18
intruders and burglar I was going to say and burgers and if someone tries to enter the door
10:38:23
is locked and the alarm will go off of course this is a video that I completely recorded I didn't take another seller's
10:38:29
uh content here and that's it really quick and the points up to the point where I open the door but it shows the
10:38:35
product in action right it shows me installing it uh I'm showing that it's uh nice and tight I try to open the door
10:38:40
the alarm goes off you guys may remember that I don't really have the alarm I had to go to another video take the audio
10:38:46
sample from the alarm arm and add it here while I'm trying to open the door and that is simply because if you
10:38:51
remember correctly I didn't order the right variation for this product I ordered the variation that comes without
10:38:57
the alarm very stupid but we learned from our mistakes and it actually paid off because my creative solution of
10:39:03
getting that alarm sound from another video actually played out here okay so that is the video in second place it's
10:39:09
at 1,000 views at the moment and guys remember this is organic I'm not paying any money to get this traffic right here
10:39:16
it's really easy to do once you learn the steps and you have the right tools to do it so again these
10:39:21
are the 10 videos you can see 10 videos five for each product and besides one
10:39:27
besides two they all did relatively well so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the top three videos from each
10:39:33
product and those are the videos that I'm going to put my money on and now we're going to move to the next section but let me also show you the results
10:39:39
from the other channels so YouTube again big success for just a couple days of
10:39:44
running organic marketing we're getting getting subscribers we're getting views we're starting to build a nice little
10:39:50
small community here and the videos are just simply working well I like that and
10:39:56
that's because we put all of the right elements here you can see that everything is a recent upload right because everything here is new and there
10:40:02
is text at the beginning there is text at the beginning at the first frame which I think is important even though I
10:40:08
do see that here it wasn't really implemented I don't remember exactly what we did there but we can see the
10:40:14
patterns we can see what's working why it's working especially this one over here that got
10:40:19
over 60 likes that's almost at 2,000 views okay so all is great thank you
10:40:24
YouTube we are going to continue working with you obviously now let's move on to the second one Facebook didn't do as
10:40:31
well and I did mention that Facebook reals is not its big thing Facebook of
10:40:36
course is just trying to hop on the shorts video bandwagon and we are not using Facebook in order to get all of
10:40:44
the organic views on our video content and make sales but we ar here on Facebook to build a community and that
10:40:51
is why I mentioned how important it is to build your community create posts on Facebook talk about your products talk
10:40:57
about other things that are related to your products make funny posts make informational posts and slowly start to
10:41:03
build your community people will find your page if it is close to something that they are searching for if it is
10:41:08
close to an interest that they have and that is how you start to slowly build your community here on Facebook but hey
10:41:14
if they have reals and I already have the videos I might as as well post them right so we can see that some here made 19 views 15 views 17 views again nothing
10:41:22
that you can make your business with but it is good for your brand recognition so
10:41:28
again you already have the content you might as well post it on Facebook as well and last but not least is Tik Tok
10:41:34
now I did have a little mistake here on Tik Tok and that is why the videos here did not pick up as you can see just a
10:41:40
few views because they were just uploaded today like just a couple hours ago so I'm still waiting for the
10:41:46
algorithm to work here and the reason that I missed a few days here is because when I created the Tik Tok account I
10:41:52
forgot my password right not very smart I use a software called last pass that keeps all my passwords in one place but
10:41:59
I didn't add it to last pass I did generate a random password that of course I cannot remember and when I did
10:42:05
a I forgot my password so I can log into my account to upload the rest of the videos it sent me a verification to my
10:42:11
email I didn't get the verification I retried several times until it just locked me out so I had to create a new
10:42:17
account I just uploaded new videos now and so I'm still waiting for that to pick up so those are Road bumps which
10:42:22
you may also experience along the way and I'm trying to keep this video as transparent as possible and that is why
10:42:28
I want you to know that today I created a new account I uploaded new content to Tik Tok I'm expecting it to pick up just
10:42:33
like it did on YouTube but until that happens we already have the data on YouTube and I strongly strongly
10:42:40
recommend to work on these three major platforms especially Tik Tok and YouTube but do not neglect Facebook and the rest
10:42:47
of the social media platforms you already have the content all you need to do is post okay so since we already have
10:42:54
enough data here on YouTube we know what to work with so now we say thank you to organic marketing we're going to
10:43:01
continue testing out new videos we're going to record more videos we're going to add them as organic content to our
10:43:06
products to our stores because that is a strategy that simply works and from that we are now going to use the data that we
10:43:12
have and turn that into paid marketing so what we're going to do now is we're going to run ads on two different
10:43:18
platforms the first is Tik Tok and the second is Facebook now there are more platforms where we can run our ads on
10:43:24
like YouTube ads Google ads Pinterest ads Instagram ads and more the reason that I'm not doing that here is because
10:43:30
well I am kind of limited on the time that I have this video is way longer than I intended it to be and these are
10:43:36
the top platforms so I want to stick with the best and of course when you will have more time and you will be able
10:43:42
to put in more effort you are going to use those other platforms as well but I'm going to stick with the top to just
10:43:47
to show you how to get it done on these important platforms once you have it down here it'll be very easy for you to take it on to the rest of the platforms
10:43:54
so tick talk and Facebook ads and I'm going to put real money on these products and I'm going to try to make my
10:44:00
sales but how did these organic videos perform on my Shopify dashboard I'm going to click here on analytics and
10:44:07
here you can see how much traffic came in how many sales and so forth and for the few days that I've been running
10:44:14
organic marketing which didn't cost me any money besides Ides of course just purchasing the products and shipping them to my house everything else was
10:44:20
completely free shooting the videos editing the videos creating my social media accounts uploading it to those social media accounts all of that is
10:44:27
completely free which is great budget friendly so we can see right here in the analytics so I had 56 viewers coming
10:44:33
from my organic videos which is not a big number but remember that my links are not clickable on my social media
10:44:39
platforms yet that is because I still didn't do the verification on YouTube YouTube wants you to verify yourself
10:44:45
verify your account pass verification before it makes your links clickable and on Tik Tok well you know what happened
10:44:50
on Tik Tok but also you need to have at least 1,000 followers in order to make your links clickable so you can have
10:44:57
links but the user is going to have to highlight it on their PC or on their mobile click on copy go to the browser
10:45:03
and click on paste so you are making them work a little bit harder especially if you don't verify your accounts and
10:45:08
you don't have a th followers yet on Tik Tok which is fine you can work on those things verify your account it's really
10:45:13
quick and easy get 1,000 followers on Tik Tok that'll happen within time and that way your links will be clickable
10:45:18
and more people will obviously click on your organic videos but anyway I only made the organic videos in order to see
10:45:25
what videos are working what Hooks people like and then I'm not just going to bet my money on hooks that don't work videos that don't really work and if I
10:45:32
make any sales from it then that's just a bonus so we can see right here that I got four add to cards so four people
10:45:39
from the 56 actually took the product and added it to their cards now why didn't they reach a checkout and why
10:45:45
didn't they convert I don't know and quite frankly I don't care like I said I'm not looking to make sales from the
10:45:50
organic videos that would have just been a bonus I just want to know what videos work but it's nice to see that four of
10:45:56
those people added the product to their cards and what I can also do now in order to try to reel them back to my
10:46:02
store is here on marketing I'm going to click on automations and I want to have
10:46:08
the abandoned card enabled so I'm just going to turn this on and what this does is Shopify will remind customers who
10:46:14
added products to their carts and then they just left the website they abandoned it it's going to try to recover them by sending them emails hey
10:46:21
you know we think you forgot this product come back and purchase it okay so I'm just going to go ahead and turn
10:46:26
that on it's being done in the background I don't mind I don't care if Shopify of course tries to help me out
10:46:32
with making me more sales and there's another one here abandoned product browse engage customers who viewed a
10:46:38
product page but didn't add anything to their card that is absolutely great let's turn that on also okay so we're
10:46:44
now recovering celles with re-engagement automation and that is also going to help turn some of these add to Cards
10:46:51
into actual purchases okay so we got traffic we got some ad to cards and all of that is coming from organic traffic
10:46:57
which worked pretty well on YouTube and if we wouldn't have had the issues on Tik Tok I'm sure that these numbers would have been Multiplied on that
10:47:04
platform as well because Tik Tok is Pioneer of short videos and YouTube is
10:47:09
just kind of tagging along just like Facebook and everyone else so I'm glad to see that I was able to get nice results on YouTube I know I would have
10:47:16
gotten more on Tik Tok but we already know what videos work and that is good enough for me all right so Tik Tok ads
10:47:23
let's go ahead and begin in order to create our first Tik Tok ad campaign the
10:47:28
first thing that we need to do is register for a Tik Tok ads account doesn't cost any money we just need to register for that account and fill in
10:47:34
our information now by the time I'm recording this video Tik Tok has an amazing signup deal to their ads account
10:47:41
so if you're going to use the affiliate link to sign up for a Tik Tok ads account that I left right below this video and also inside the cheat sheet
10:47:48
you're going to make it to this page right here discover new rewards to supercharge your ads and here you'll be
10:47:53
able to see Tik Talk's latest offer now by the time you're watching this video If this offer changed you will see the
10:48:00
updated offer after clicking the link and hopefully it won't change because this is an amazing offer so take
10:48:05
advantage of it while you can because it is a limited time offer so what you're going to get here if you use the Tik Tok
10:48:11
ads registration link that I left below this video and you're going to click right here on claim offer then you're
10:48:17
going to be taken to the Tik Tok ads registration page so here you're going to write your email address and your
10:48:23
desired password then you're going to click here to agree to the terms and conditions you do not have to subscribe
10:48:29
to emails if you don't want to click on continue and it will create your adverti your account now once you did that
10:48:34
through this link then what you're going to get is once you spend $30 you're going to get $20 back that you can use
10:48:41
in ad spend if you spend $100 you're going to get a $100 back in ad spend if
10:48:46
you spend $200 you're going to get $200 back and if you spend $500 you're going to get $500 back so when you get this
10:48:54
money back Tik Tok will allow you to reuse it back into running ads this means that you can run two times more
10:49:00
ads than you initially wanted to because they're going to give you back the money that you spent so according to what you
10:49:06
can see right here you're going to get that money back and you're going to be able to scale your ads and run two times
10:49:12
more ads than you initially wanted to because Tik Tok is giving you free money so all of that is laid out right here
10:49:19
and also inside the cheat sheet again take advantage of it while you can because it is a limited time offer and I
10:49:25
cannot guarantee that it's going to work all year long so if you want access to this cheat sheet that I have prepared
10:49:32
for you in this long video all you got to do is comment right below # Shopify
10:49:37
let me know what is your top takeaway from this video and I'm going to reply back with a link to this cheat sheet and
10:49:42
you're going to have all the resources and all the links that I'm going over in this video of course if you appreciate all content do not forget to like share
10:49:49
subscribe I want to see your engagements let me know if this is the type of content that you are looking for this is
10:49:55
the type of stuff that you want to learn and I will continue creating more and more until you are finally successful
10:50:01
with your business and opening more streams more networks of income so if you want to know if the offer still
10:50:07
stands again use the registration link and claim your offer while you still can and run double the ads for the same
10:50:14
amount of money and make those extra sales and profit so I'm going to go ahead and click on claim offer and let's
10:50:20
go ahead and start this registration all right so let's do this together and run our first Tik Tok ads so I'm going to go
10:50:26
ahead and click on claim offer and begin the Tik Tok ads registration process then you're going to add your
10:50:32
information so industry you're going to choose e-commerce and here you can choose your Niche or just go ahead and
10:50:37
choose other your business name so in my case it's Prime jungle you can enter
10:50:43
your phone number right here link to your website you don't really have to and add your billing information and go
10:50:50
ahead and click on get started I'm not going to do it because it's already been done on my side and what happens then is
10:50:55
you're going to be logged in to your Tik Tok ads manager which will look like this so this is a dashboard we don't
10:51:00
really have any campaigns any ads going on at the moment we will soon so this is the greeting screen that you are going
10:51:06
to be greeted with all right so let's go ahead and create our first ad now if you already have a Tik Tok ads manager or
10:51:13
even a Tik Tok Business Center which looks like this it doesn't really cost any money to open up a business center
10:51:18
you can even use an account that you have and just convert that to a business account but then you will not really be
10:51:23
able to enjoy the perks and benefits of getting money back because you did not sign up using this link so even if you
10:51:30
already have a business center and you want to create your ads by going here under Advertiser accounts and you're
10:51:36
going to create an Advertiser account here then you're going to go to ads manager and it's going to open up the ads manager as we have here so if you
10:51:43
already have a business account I just recommend creating a new Tik to advertising account whether it's
10:51:48
connected to the business account or not just so that you can get money back on your ads now if you already have a
10:51:54
business manager on Tik Tok right and you don't have the ads account yet or
10:52:00
you have an ads account connected to your business center but it's not the ads account that was created with the
10:52:05
referral link that's going to give you money back then that's okay you can keep your business account but create your
10:52:11
ads account through the referral link that I showed you inside the Shopify cheat sheet and then you can just
10:52:17
connect it to your business center right here so you can connect multiple Advertiser accounts here so after you
10:52:22
create your Advertiser account and you already have a business center just click here on ADD advertise your account
10:52:28
and instead of creating a new one you're going to request access click on next say that you're an admin and then put
10:52:33
your ads account ID here you can get your ads account ID by going to your ads manager click on your name right here on
10:52:41
the top right and then you'll have the ID here so you want to copy that paste it here and then it will allow you to do
10:52:47
the connection and add your Advertiser account to your existing business center
10:52:53
okay so the ads manager is right here and this is where we are going to start running our ads so the first thing that I'm going to do is click here on create
10:53:00
ad and you can also follow the steps on this cheat sheet right so you created your Tik Tok ads account you're going to
10:53:05
get some money back then you're going to add your payment and billing info this is only for the first run I already
10:53:10
added mine even if you don't add it in the beginning it is going to ask you right before you start running your ad
10:53:16
to add your payment and billing info okay and this of course is to pay for the ads because here we are paying for
10:53:22
the ads we're paying for every time it shows someone the ad or every time someone clicks we're overall paying Tik
10:53:27
Tok money now and we are going to be bidding with other advertisers in the same Niche or to the same audiences for
10:53:33
these ad copies that we are now creating but we are smarter we already have data on what videos will work for us so our
10:53:40
risk is much much lower and the data that we're going to get here is outstanding much better than running
10:53:45
organic videos okay so the first thing that's going to ask you is what is your advertising objective and here you have
10:53:52
a whole bunch of objectives like oh I just want to reach as many people as possible I want to get as much traffic as possible I want as many video views
10:53:59
as possible which again this is not what we are currently looking for you could go for traffic right cuz here it's going
10:54:06
to look for people who like to click on websites but mainly our goal is website conversions okay so I'm going to click
10:54:12
on that this is what I'm I want to get people to do I want to drive valuable actions on my website not just visit my
10:54:19
website not just watch the video right because I'm not just trying to increase my brand recognition or to get people to
10:54:26
know something about something from the video that I'm showing them I want them to click on it I want them to see the product but not just traffic I want them
10:54:33
to also convert that is my end goal so I'm going to go with website conversions now you can also go with product sales
10:54:40
but this is more driven this is more recommended for people who are selling from within TI T Tok even though it says
10:54:47
website but it is mainly going to promote these products using video shopping ads live shopping ads or
10:54:53
product shopping ads that's not what we're looking for and also catalog promote your products from a catalog using video shopping ads we're not using
10:54:59
all of that so we are going with website conversions and you can see here under campaign type that it also gives us the
10:55:05
option for a Smart Plus campaign this is a relatively new feature that they just added and I am personally not going to
10:55:11
trust it because Facebook does the same thing and I've been running Facebook ads for years and I usually do not use their
10:55:17
automatic campaign optimization feature because then it's more automatic placements what Facebook thinks will be
10:55:24
good and Facebook also wants to take my money just like any other social media platform so we're going to make sure
10:55:30
that they get the least amount of money while also giving us the highest amount of results that's the only way that
10:55:36
we're going to get the best Roi the best return on our investment so we're going to do a little bit more manual work and
10:55:42
not let them decide what's good for us so improve ad performance with automated campaign management and smart
10:55:48
optimization like placement selection audience targeting and more so I'm not going to turn that on I want to manually
10:55:54
select these things okay so website conversions scroll down campaign name you can go ahead and give the campaign a
10:56:01
name so I just want you to know that there are three sections to running a paid ad the first is the campaign right
10:56:07
so now I'm running a campaign for this specific product and then you've got your adsets and then you've got your ads
10:56:14
so the adsets are connected to the campaign and the ads are connected to
10:56:19
the ad sets so soon you'll see what each section is responsible for but mainly now we are naming the campaign right the
10:56:26
big overall picture so this is going to be for the firmest Trio I'm going to
10:56:32
call the campaign for Miss Trio because everything that I'm going to run here is only going to be for this product so that can be the campaign okay then we've
10:56:38
got special ad categories so it's not really relevant for us it's only if you're selling houses or jobs or credits
10:56:45
and things like that next you also have the option to create a split test so what this will do is it'll show your
10:56:50
split test to to two separate audiences to give you more data driven results as they call it select a variable and
10:56:56
create your test ad group and then you can view the results but I really want to select my target audiences so I don't
10:57:01
want them to do it for me then you've got campaign budget optimization so this is another way to tell Tik Tok hey
10:57:09
here's the amount of money you can do whatever you want with it spread it across the adsets and the ads and T will
10:57:14
be like okay well we'll just put it we think is right so if this ad is getting lots of views we're going to put more
10:57:19
budget into that if this one is not getting we can kind of take money away from there that is great but from my
10:57:25
experience it usually doesn't work as good as we wanted to it's best to have your eyes on your ads and you will be
10:57:31
the deciding factor when it's time to turn it off and I will walk you through the process of when the ad is working
10:57:36
well when it isn't when it's time to turn it off and when it's time to scale it even more and that is after I finish
10:57:42
running the ads we wait a few days we see the results so we're going to get to that so for now I'm going to leave out
10:57:47
as much automatic work as possible I want to put as much manual work as I can into these ads not only will I be
10:57:53
smarter because I will be controlling the data but I will also know how to do it better for the next times and it's
10:57:59
just simply much much better this way so I'm going to leave campaign budget optimization off and set campaign budget
10:58:05
you can do that but I'm not going to put a budget on the campaign at the moment one because we don't have to and second
10:58:12
because I want us to be in control and in order for us to be in control we will decide when to turn off the campaigns
10:58:18
and we don't want to set a budget because if for example I say okay my budget is $10 per day for the whole
10:58:25
campaign and the campaign is working really really well and the $10 have been spent and now it'll just turn off my ads
10:58:32
while they're running while they're driving traffic while they're making sales all of a sudden big stop because you bre your budget limit so we don't
10:58:39
want that I'm going to leave that off okay so the only thing that we did do here was select website conversions for
10:58:44
the advertising objective for the campaign we gave the campaign a name and we're going to click on continue okay
10:58:50
now it's the ad group or the ad set whatever you want to call it so this is the next section and this is where we
10:58:56
will be targeting our audiences our demo graphics and configuring our placement
10:59:01
connecting the Tik Tock pixel which I'll explain in a minute and give it a daily
10:59:06
budget and then we are going to finally connect it with the ad the ad is where we select what videos to run and here
10:59:12
I'm going to select the top three videos so basically what what I'm doing here is I'm going to keep the same campaign the
10:59:18
same ad sets or ad groups with the placements and the only difference is going to be the video ads right the the
10:59:25
type of content that I'm going to show these audiences under this campaign all right so the ad group name is again fir
10:59:32
Miss Trio I'm going to keep it the same as the campaign there's no reason to make it different now optimization location okay so here you're saying okay
10:59:39
is this going are we driving traffic to a website or is it to a Tik Tok instant page which obviously it's not a Tik Tok
10:59:45
instant page where we're not making sales from Tik Tok we're making sales from our website so we're going to
10:59:50
choose website and here Tik Tok wants us to connect Tik Tok pixel in order for us
10:59:55
to understand the events and the customer Behavior that's happening on our website so what this means in other
11:00:01
words is Facebook has the same thing it's called Facebook pixel I'm pretty sure it started from there because I don't remember having pixels anywhere
11:00:07
else before Facebook came out with the pixel so this is simply an API connection to our store and it will be
11:00:14
able to get all of the customers behaviors on our website what products they clicked on where they clicked on
11:00:20
where they clicked out how many add to carts how many checkouts how many abandoned cards it's going to take all
11:00:26
of this information from all of the people who are entering our website and then what it can do is now it's starting
11:00:33
to have some data now the Tik Tok pixel the more data we give it from customers who clicked who entered our website
11:00:40
right so it's already somewhat relevant people right they clicked on our ads it means that they engage with a product
11:00:46
and they clicked on it to get to our website and now they're doing some stuff on our website whether they purchased or not the pixel is going to record
11:00:53
everything that they're doing and now what the pixel will get is a whole bunch of data from customers okay so we have
11:00:59
these people who clicked add to cart and let's see what these types of people are
11:01:05
like who are these people what are their interests what are their behaviors what type of stuff do they like and then what
11:01:10
the Tik Tok can do is okay we're GNA match that we're going to match these audiences that you know clicked on your
11:01:16
website and did a couple of stuff did a few events like clicked and viewed and and added to card and stuff like that
11:01:22
we're going to take their information their patterns and we are going to try to match that with customer data with
11:01:27
audience data that we have on Tik Tok because we have millions of customers and we have millions of data so we are
11:01:33
going to try to match those customers that engage on your website and we're going to look for customers with similar
11:01:39
interests similar targeting and we're going to look for them for this type of people on Tik Tok to try to drive
11:01:46
those types of audiences to your website because in the beginning when you're running ads Tik Tok Facebook whatever
11:01:52
you're using they have no idea where to get your audiences and the more data you can give them the more they'll be able
11:01:58
to narrow down who is relevant to purchase the product from your website so the more data we give the pixel the
11:02:05
more it knows how to go back to its own platform and look for similar audiences that are more relevant because these are
11:02:11
the types of people similar types of people who created events on our websites okay so that is the best way
11:02:17
that I can explain at the moment what the pixel is and what it does so now we're just going to connect that pixel to our website okay so set up your data
11:02:24
connection a Tik Tok pixel or events API integration is needed to measure campaigns and optimize towards outcomes
11:02:29
on your site so we're going to go ahead and click on get started okay so we're following the steps here on the cheat sheet so we type the ad group name
11:02:35
optimization location is website and now we're setting up the Tik Tok pixel okay so let's go back to that so identity
11:02:41
verification required so I'm going to go with email instead of phone send that my email address send a verification codee
11:02:48
okay here's my verification code copy and paste it back over
11:02:54
here and it's doing it again okay now our verification is
11:03:01
turned on all right so the first thing that it's asking is add your website so very obvious our website is prime
11:03:07
jungle. store my website your website is something else click on next okay choose
11:03:12
data connection method so we're going to go with partner Integrations because we are using Shopify right here so we're
11:03:18
going to click on that and click on next okay and now which one from all of these integration Partners is of course
11:03:23
Shopify click next okay now we need to install the Tik Tok app on Shopify so we can go ahead and get started by clicking
11:03:29
on get started on Shopify here it's going to add the Tik Tok app now we're going to click on install Okay Tik Tok
11:03:35
ons all this click on install okay now that it's installed we are going to start the next step which is to start on
11:03:41
boarding so we're going to click on setup now under the Tik Tok Channel overview
11:03:46
and that is here under Tik Tok marketing so set up now connect Tik Tok for
11:03:51
business now if you don't have a business account on this part because you only created an ads account that
11:03:56
could happen so you're just going to create a new business account by clicking here on create new and then you
11:04:02
can connect the business account with the uh ads account so I'm just going to go ahead and click on connect since I already have my business account and
11:04:07
you're going to connect to that business account okay and here of course we're going with prime jungle click connect
11:04:13
okay the ads manager is prime jungle clickn conect under data sharing we'll keep it on maximum to get the most
11:04:20
amount of data that we can from the pixel and that's pretty much it we can just go ahead and click on confirm right
11:04:25
here okay nice and easy finish setup and now if I go back to the ads
11:04:32
manager I can see that here it doesn't tell me to connect my to a new Tik Tok pixel but rather finish data connection
11:04:39
setup no activity has been reported from this data connection check that the setup is complete and test events so now we're just going to test a couple events
11:04:45
EV make sure that they work and then we're going to come back here and continue working on our ads after we know that the Tik Tok pixel is
11:04:52
successfully installed so I'm going to click here on continue setup and it's going to take me directly to my Tik Tok pixel okay great so here is my Tik Tok
11:04:59
pixel and as I scroll down we can see all of the different events that it's going to be taking right here so every
11:05:06
time a customer views content right so they view a my product page that's
11:05:11
called view content if they search for something on my website right there's a search function on the top if they
11:05:16
initiate checkout complete payment add to card or add payment info so and/or to
11:05:21
all of these events it's going to gather this data from these types of customers and like I said they're going to search for similar patterns on their platform
11:05:28
and that way the more data that we give them the more they'll be able to narrow it down on their data on their audiences
11:05:33
and get more relevant audiences to visit our store while we're running Tik Tok ads so in the beginning the data is
11:05:39
going to be scattered all over the place we're not going to get a lot of results the more we run the ads the more time we give it the more the results will be
11:05:45
better and the more audience that will start coming into our store will be more relevant to check out and purchase the
11:05:50
product all right so before we continue let's test the events on our pixel make sure that the pixel is successfully installed on our website before we start
11:05:56
running ads so in order to test the pixel we're going to click right here on test events and here it's asking for the
11:06:01
URL which I mean come on Tik Tok you should know it by now but here it is it's Prime jungle. store and now it's
11:06:07
going to generate a QR code it wants us to scan this code with our mobile phone and then interact with our website after
11:06:13
using the QR code once Cen is received correctly it'll appear on the screen so the reason that it's doing it this way
11:06:18
is it only wants to capture audience data that come from the ads from the Tik Tok ads that we're about to run not if
11:06:24
someone from somewhere else from the blog post or from anywhere else clicks on our website Tik Tok only wants a data
11:06:30
that's coming from a certain place so now it's doing the same thing it's saying okay we're going to give you a QR code now we're going to get data that's
11:06:36
coming from this certain place and we'll see that the pixel of course is picking up on that data okay so I'm going to click on generate QR code now let me
11:06:43
bust up my mobile phone open up up the code scanner all right let me scan that really quick okay and here I am now on
11:06:50
the website on our website of the store okay so I'm just going to go ahead and
11:06:56
scroll let's click on the main product okay so now it's going to open up uh alert Guard Pro and look we got a view
11:07:03
content as we speak now I'm going to do uh an add to cart okay so we want to make sure that that works we can see
11:07:09
right here view content uh the connection method is the browser and this just happened right now okay so
11:07:14
what I'm going to do now is is I'm going to click on add to card by the way I don't know if you guys noticed but the
11:07:19
website is super super mobile friendly I don't know how well you guys can see it when I'm doing it like this I could also
11:07:25
record my Mobile screen and show it to you guys but trust me that it looks absolutely amazing super mobile friendly
11:07:31
everything is in place okay so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to click on add to cart this button right here and
11:07:36
let's see how fast it catches on so here's the button add to cart let's go ahead and click on
11:07:44
it I didn't click click on it did I here all right just clicked on it
11:07:49
now and there it is add to card so I can see that the events are working so the
11:07:54
Tik Tok pixel is installed successfully on the website and by the way frequently bought together looks really good on the
11:08:00
website too all right so let's test the events again so you can see right now I'm recording my screen so you can see
11:08:05
the mobile view on my website all right so as we know this is our website it looks nice as we said mobile friendly
11:08:12
we've got all the categories right here okay so let's add add this time let's add the Fus Trio so I'm going to click
11:08:18
on that and now I'm going to what well let's look at the rest of the stuff so
11:08:24
we do see they frequently bought together right here so this is the frequently bought together app and here
11:08:29
we've got the nice product description that was helpfully generated by AI we've got the
11:08:36
product reviews right here and you may also like so other
11:08:42
products that they may buy and then they can read the reviews here and they can see the pictures of other customers who
11:08:47
purchased this product this is of course using the uh judge me mobile app and
11:08:53
this is our footer menu and you can see the sticky add to cart right here at the bottom so it's always always there they
11:08:59
can click on whatever variation they want to purchase right and then they can just click on add to cart at any time on
11:09:06
our website so everything looks good everything is mobile friendly and we can
11:09:12
see that another add to content event was added to our website and if we do another add to
11:09:19
card and I'm also going to check click on checkout this time so we should now see two more events an add to card and
11:09:27
also a checkout so let's give it a minute and see that it shows up there we
11:09:32
go add to card and we have initiate checkout now of course the payment is not complete so we don't have a complete
11:09:38
purchase but we can see that the website events are working okay so we saw the
11:09:43
mobile view and we saw that the events are working so we know that the pixel works it's installed correctly let's
11:09:50
continue with the ad setup so next is placements so automatically show your ads across supported placements or you
11:09:57
select a placement where to show the targeting and of course we are going to do things as manually as possible when
11:10:03
it comes to running ads it's our money and we want to do it in the best best way possible so we're going to click on
11:10:08
select placement and we are going to untick everything that is not Tik Tok I only want my ad to be sh on Tik Tok I
11:10:16
only want to give Tik Tok money to show my ads on their platform I understand
11:10:22
that they have a nice partnership with this app called global app bundle and also pengle but I don't know you apps
11:10:28
you guys are not nearly as big as Tik Tok and I know that you will not give me the results that I need so we're only
11:10:33
going to leave Tik Tok ticked in when it comes to placements so our targeting our ads are going to be only only on Tik Tok
11:10:40
and Tik tok's audience next is targeting so here is where we start targeting our
11:10:46
target audience and here while we are going worldwide the US is our main
11:10:52
target audience so here we can do a couple of things and this is also where it could get pretty tricky so if I
11:11:00
Target the whole world right now with this ad and I give Tik Tok let's say $5 or $10 a day to run ads on this product
11:11:07
to the worldwide audience it's going to move slowly from one country to the
11:11:12
other to the other there's going to be a lot of countries a lot of states to to go over and it's not going to skip to
11:11:17
the next one until it really exhausts the first option and then the next one and then the next one so by the time it
11:11:22
reaches the United States which is my target audience it could take a lot of time and a lot of money until it reaches
11:11:28
my target audience on the other hand I don't want to neglect the worldwide audience because I want everybody to be
11:11:34
able to purchase this product it's not only for people who live in the US but because the US has the highest buying
11:11:39
power and it's much easier to make sales there than that is my target audience it's still going to be my target
11:11:44
audience however the rest of the world again is not going to see this ad so what we can do is a couple of things one
11:11:51
we can run this ad set right this ad group only to the US and I could
11:11:57
duplicate this ad set and then run another ad group that's still related to the same campaign so I'm going to have
11:12:02
two ad groups where the second one is only targeting the worldwide audience that's not the United States and that
11:12:08
way I can compare the US to the rest of the world and see how that is performing however the rest of the world is going
11:12:14
to take a higher bud to be able to get a lot of data and not just from one country but I wanted to move over all of
11:12:20
the countries in the world and see where my relevant audience resides that's going to take a larger budget especially
11:12:26
in the beginning because Tik Tok does not have that data and it wants to really check each country well before
11:12:31
moving on and it can do some simultaneous checking checking a few countries at the same time so I might
11:12:37
try that for one ad group even though I know that most sales are going to come from the US and that is where I should
11:12:43
be putting my money even if I go back to YouTube and I check where the 6,000
11:12:48
people who viewed my video came from I can just click right here on
11:12:54
audience scroll down and you can see right here that 46% of those views came
11:13:00
from the US now it's nice to see that people from all over the world saw these short videos right from India from
11:13:07
Russia from Germany from Philippines because they all speak English so they could read the text they could understand what's going on but the
11:13:13
majority is coming from the United States and this is where I want to put my money now male and female you can see
11:13:20
that more males watch it rather than females but 6040 is not that far apart
11:13:25
from one another so I will be targeting both genders and the age range also helps me out now anyway I wanted to run
11:13:33
this ad from the age group of around 18 to 40 that was my initial thought we can
11:13:39
go a little bit further as to let's say up to the age of 45 which is still fine we can't go until 54 I'm going to go
11:13:46
from 18 to 45 okay because anyone from this age range can have pets even after 45 people 56 years old also have pets
11:13:53
but that's where the results kind of start to die down I want to put my money at the right spot so in this case it's
11:13:59
definitely going to be the United States okay so that is why again we need short video content to give us data and to
11:14:06
help us narrow down our audiences for once we start to actually put real money into it okay so here we're going to
11:14:12
leave the location on the United States the age range as we saw is 18 until 35
11:14:17
to 44 45 to 54 again it's not the highest percentages 45 to 54 that's
11:14:24
about 12% but they probably have a better buying power than those who are 18 and
11:14:31
barely have jobs yet so I will add that as well anyway if the algorithm cannot
11:14:36
reach that many people because there aren't that many 50-year olds on Tik Tok It's Quickly going to move from them
11:14:43
back to 35 or 3 4 or 25 wherever it gets the more relevant audiences that match
11:14:49
the goals of our campaign okay so next gender we're going to leave it on all we saw that it's about 60% male 40% female
11:14:55
give or take a few percentages languages from all I can change that only to English even though most people in the
11:15:02
US are only going to speak English but I will narrow it down even to those that don't speak English at all and reside in
11:15:07
the US I don't want to show these ads to you okay so only English spending power leave it on all household income leave
11:15:13
it on all by the way most this stuff is written here right so you've got your placements Tik Tok only targeting
11:15:19
demographics us or wherever your target audience is age gender uh language is
11:15:24
English and interest and behaviors is where we're at now okay so interest and behaviors and you can keep this Broad
11:15:30
and just say okay I don't care what interest they have it can be any interest and this is kind of tricky because I'm looking for pet owners but
11:15:37
if anyone didn't say in their profile in their Tik Tok profile that this is one of their interests or Tik Tok has no
11:15:43
idea that they have pets then it's not going to Target those people so on the one hand you do want to keep it broad on
11:15:50
the other hand you do kind of want to narrow it down to people who are relevant so the more broad you keep it which right now you can see that it's
11:15:56
called balanced and for Tik Tok a balanced audience is between 76 to 93
11:16:01
million people that is a lot a lot of people and we're going to have to spend a lot of money to show ads to a lot of
11:16:08
irrelevant people until it starts to find the ones that are relevant so I would like to help narrow it down a bit
11:16:14
and save some money but I also don't want to exclude others who could be relevant for this so this part can get a
11:16:19
bit tricky I do want to get a nice balanced number here but 76 to 93 million that's going to take a lot of
11:16:25
money before we start to see significant results so here there's a couple of things that you can do you will have
11:16:32
more time than me and you're going to fill in this audience research spreadsheet which is linked inside the cheat sheet if you click on that you're
11:16:39
going to get these questions okay so you're going to get a nice little questionnaire here who are the authority figures influencers and big brands in
11:16:44
your Niche right so let's say it's pet owners who are the authority figures of pet uh of pet products uh influencers
11:16:50
and big Brands when it comes to pet products right so I could say uh for example um uh PetSmart right everybody
11:16:57
knows or almost everybody knows about uh PetSmart and other stores like that what books magazines and websites does your
11:17:03
audience engage with what types of events does the audience attend and what other relevant products does your audience use if you're not sure how to
11:17:09
answer these questions you can write it on Google you can use our good friend chat GPT in this case case I will be
11:17:15
using chat GPT but once you answer all these questions you're going to add these into the audience interest and
11:17:20
it's going to be able to narrow down a relevant target audience for your product but because I don't have the
11:17:25
luxury of time as much as you will I'm just going to start with Chad GPT right from the top you can also do that you can mix in both methods I highly though
11:17:33
recommend using the audience research spreadsheet because it will help you understand your target audience interests okay so here I'm just going to
11:17:39
start from the top so generate audience interests that will purchase my product
11:17:47
let's make it even more specific generate audience interest for running paid ads on Tik Tok for the target
11:17:56
audience that will purchase my product the product is a pet steam brush to
11:18:05
effectively Target the Right audience for your pet steam brush on Tik Tok you can consider the following interest pet based on pet owner's Behavior and the
11:18:11
benefits of your product Okay so we've got all of these interest which is quite a lot and it's all really related to
11:18:18
pets so hopefully our Target audiences have these interests in mind and let's
11:18:23
go completely with chat GPT here okay so I'm going to go back to the ads manager
11:18:28
I can close a Tik Tok pixel we see that it works it's very nice thank you very much we can close this window okay so
11:18:35
back to the interests here so I'm just going to take these interests like pet grooming and I'm going to add it here
11:18:41
okay so we've got pet grooming as an interest but we also have it at as a purchase intention which is nice it
11:18:47
could be even better because these are people who have an interest for pet grooming with an intent to purchase the
11:18:53
product I'm going to go with purchase intention but also with interests so you can see that it added pet grooming twice
11:19:00
which is fine okay next pet care that's definitely relevant so again we're going to click on search pet care and here it
11:19:07
is additional interest and you can also see the audience size right so we can see that the potential audience size for
11:19:13
petare is one .2 to 1.5 million which is not a lot so of course we have to add
11:19:18
more and more interests but you can see now that the available audience is much much more narrowed down which is great
11:19:25
now Tik Tok is saying hey guys it's too narrowed we might not find them but between us 4 million is a pretty good
11:19:32
number but we will try to increase it just a bit okay so next let's also add pet
11:19:38
owners okay so pet owners additional interests and this is a very narrow down
11:19:43
audience so 300,00 to 400,000 is not a lot but it's not going to narrow down
11:19:48
our audiences further below than what it has now right now we're expanding the narrowed audience we're expanding it to
11:19:55
a bigger audience okay so pet accessories not really sure that's kind of maybe a little bit too broad but
11:20:02
let's see if we have any nice yeah 4,000 to 6,000 that that's just way too low okay let's go for animal lovers oh I
11:20:09
added it by accident ah never mind it's okay to have that as well if it doesn't find anything relevant there it quickly
11:20:14
jumps out out all right Next by the way you can always remove them as well but right now let's continue we can always
11:20:20
remove them also from here you know what let's remove them all right next animal lovers yeah that that's just a weird one
11:20:26
veterinarian tips um this is maybe a little bit more for vets but you know we
11:20:31
could probably get vets to purchase this product as well let's see if there's anything like that here no how about
11:20:39
just vetar veterinarian um additional interests I don't know what the target audience is here 1.5 to 1.8 mil that's
11:20:47
good let's also add that okay next pet Cleaning Solutions that's not really an interest
11:20:53
eco-friendly products way too broad doesn't have to do with pets pet friendly homes pet comfort and hygiene
11:21:00
maybe pet hygiene let's see pet hygiene nope luxury pet products
11:21:08
pet related do-it-yourself tips and pet influencers so yeah not really so right
11:21:15
now our target audience is 4.9 to 6 million and I'm just going to add a few
11:21:20
more just to kind of broaden that a little bit more even though I think that we should find enough buyers around this
11:21:27
number but let's add something just a little bit more broad just in case it's not able to find enough let's add
11:21:33
something like this adjust in here pets let's see how much we have around that okay so this is around 60 to 70 million
11:21:39
that's a lot let's go for a purchase intention how much do we have there 3 to 4 million so I'm going going to go ahead
11:21:45
and add that okay now we're around 6 to 8 million and if I add the interest I think that this is just too much but
11:21:50
let's try now we're back to being balance at around 38 million guys it's way too much I'm going to remove pets
11:21:57
and if this doesn't work well then I'm going to add pets and just let the algorithm get more data take more of my
11:22:04
money and be able to find more data but right now I'm only using pets for uh purchase intention so we're looking at a
11:22:10
fairly broad audience at around 7 million average uh available target
11:22:15
audience and hopefully we'll be able to find it there and if I see that it doesn't work I will come back I will
11:22:20
adjust these ads and I will add the big pets broad broad keyword and see if we
11:22:26
can find it there but I think that we're going to have a higher chance here let's also add cats dogs right so
11:22:36
cats dogs okay and again we're looking at
11:22:42
around the 7 million okay this is even if Tik Tok is tell me hey guys it's too narrow broaden it more give us more
11:22:48
money and we'll check more audiences we could do that but first let's try the narrow down approach it's going to cost us less and let's see what we can do
11:22:55
here with the data okay so this is the target audience that we will try to reach here and let's continue now we've
11:23:00
got the budget and schedule so how much do you want to spend per day and here
11:23:06
they're saying hey you know you guys you should go with $70 cuz we know that these platforms are going to try as much as possible the minimum here should be
11:23:13
around $20 if you we go below that it's going to say no no no no no you got to put at least $20 per day but remember
11:23:19
that this is just the ad group or the ad set after this we will have the ads themselves where this $20 a day can be
11:23:27
split between Those ads so you're not going to spend $20 multiplied by the amount of ads that you're running you're
11:23:34
going to spend $20 total in what you have under this ad group so if it's confusing now you'll get the picture
11:23:40
soon but for example I can say in the ad group okay my daily budget is $20 a day
11:23:45
but I'm going to only run one ad connected to this ad group at a budget of $5 per day so that's going to be the
11:23:51
limit it's going to be five it's not going to be that 20 okay if that's confusing again just bear with me and you'll understand it all soon next is
11:23:57
schedule okay so do you want this ad to start right away as soon as we approve it by the way after we run the ad we do
11:24:04
have to wait a few hours for Tik Tok to approve the ad so of course I'll show you that the approval that comes uh later but here it's asking you when do
11:24:10
you want us to start the ad as soon as we approve it or do you want to start at a certain date and time in my case I
11:24:16
don't mind starting right away if the ad is not working at certain hours it's not going to put all the budget into those
11:24:21
hours it's going to wait for the next hours it's going to look for the hot hours and this way we're going to learn what are the best hours for these
11:24:27
products okay so I'm just going to say start right away now do remember now do
11:24:32
keep in mind that if you do start that if you now do keep in mind that if you do set a start and end time the ad is
11:24:39
going to end even if you're not ready for it and this could be really bad news especially for ads that are working
11:24:44
working well so if you go with this one set start time and run ad group continuously the ad will continue to run
11:24:50
until we come and turn it off manually which as I mentioned when it comes to ads we do want to put more manual work
11:24:56
rather than automatic this way we have much better deep control into what we are putting our budgets into and we
11:25:02
won't spend money that doesn't need to be spent in places that are not relevant okay so we are going to decide when to
11:25:07
turn off the ad bidding and optimizations we know that the optimization goal is conversion we're
11:25:12
not going to change it to click or anything else Target CPA you can just leave that off and that is pretty much
11:25:18
it for the ad group all right I came back in the next day to resume this recording because what happened was I
11:25:24
was not able to continue to The Next Step because it was stuck on this pixel
11:25:30
on finishing the data connection setup even though we both saw that I finished the data connection setup and we were
11:25:36
able to complete the setup and test events and that happened because Tik Tok Works a little bit slow when it comes to
11:25:42
the pixel and I had to wait several hours for it to notice the connection and the test events that we did and that
11:25:49
the pixel is actually connected that data source is actually here so what I had to do was simply wait it out and now
11:25:55
that I came back the next day I refreshed the page and it looks like this so now the optimization location
11:26:01
actually shows that pixel that I created now the cool thing is you can even connect multiple pixels and of course
11:26:06
this is a more advanced strategy that we're not going to do now and you can choose which pixel you want to choose which one you want to use for this
11:26:13
advertising in campaign so that's a nice thing to have but it's important to know if you just created a new pixel and you
11:26:19
did your test events and everything came out nice in a test events which now you can see that it even has more
11:26:24
information and because I was kind of stuck on it I deleted the pixel I created a new one and there was even
11:26:30
another bug the add to card on my mobile store stopped working so after I showed you guys yesterday that it was working
11:26:36
and I shared my mobile view after that it stopped working every time I clicked on add to card on mobile it didn't work
11:26:42
and I thought that it was like a browser problem so I opened up uh Tik the Tik Tok app and then I scanned the code
11:26:47
again and then I opened it through Tik tok's browser and even from there the add to card stopped working only on
11:26:52
mobile on the PC it was working I didn't really understand why so what I did was I completely removed the pixel and I
11:26:59
created a new one right on the same page through right here I created a new pixel and I connected it and again I did all
11:27:06
the test events and it was working kind of in delay but the add to cart came back to work after I removed the
11:27:13
previous pixel so so if you have any bugs on your Shopify store that suddenly happened it didn't happen before but now
11:27:18
it happened you need to think what was the last things that I did on my store that could have affected it so I removed
11:27:25
the previous apps that I talked to you guys about but that didn't fix the issue so I reinstalled them again like the sticky add to card and stuff there was
11:27:31
no reason to remove them so I reinstalled them but once I removed the pixel the add to card started working again and after I reinstalled the pixel
11:27:38
the add to card continue to work so it's important to know these things and that bugs will happen along the way but we
11:27:43
need to find Solutions in order to continue to move forward do not get stuck and definitely definitely do not
11:27:49
give up all right so that's what happened here and I kept this page alive just to show you so I had this finished
11:27:55
data connection setup which I know that I finished it you need to wait come back the next day and this is what it's going
11:28:01
to look like in the next day it's going to show you the data connection that you have okay so now I can finally close this tab I kept it open so that you guys
11:28:08
can uh see where we were stuck and now we're going to continue I just want to mention one more thing about this uh events page so I did a lot more testing
11:28:16
while I was offline um I tested more events I finished the add to card I did a payment checkout I checked out with
11:28:22
the product so now it looks like I have some sales on my Shopify store which I don't really have so if I go back to my
11:28:28
dashboard now you can see that I do have more online sessions because the organic videos kept bringing me more traffic to
11:28:34
my website and here you can see an online store conversion rate so you can see that I have 12 add to cards three
11:28:39
checkouts and three sessions converted which actually finished the payment I have three total orders but guys I'm
11:28:44
here to be 100% transparent these are not real sales I simply did it to test the pixel and to make sure that all of
11:28:51
the events are working and if I continue to scroll down you can see something that is important that most of my
11:28:56
sessions are coming from the United States so that is exactly what I was shooting for and I also showed you that
11:29:03
that is what YouTube organic was showing me that it was hitting the United States and that's exactly the audience that I
11:29:08
was shooting for okay so here if I go to the orders page you can see the fake orders that I added in and the reason
11:29:14
that you see total 0 is because I simply created a promotion code that gives me
11:29:19
100% discount so I can easily check out on my website so to do that just click here on discounts on the left side and
11:29:26
create your discount so I created a new discount and this is an amount of order discount okay give your discount code
11:29:32
whatever you want like 100 secret because it's a secret only you can know about it and we're going to give a
11:29:38
percentage of 100% off and that's it create the code and when you do the F
11:29:44
checkout use this promotion code that you have on the checkout page and it'll do the fake checkout for you okay so
11:29:49
it's really easy to do and that's why it looks like I have these sales but again it's not real now hopefully we will
11:29:55
start getting the real sales so let's continue with the ad campaign on Tik Tok
11:30:00
so I chose the pixel and everything else we already did the other day and you may remember that we are targeting around 7
11:30:07
to 8 million people so I am thinking about doing a couple of things with this if I see because we should all
11:30:13
understand that this ad is not going to be shown to 7 million people just because seven or 8 million people said that they like pets and all of the stuff
11:30:20
that we chose in audience targeting it doesn't mean that all of them are going to be online right when I'm running
11:30:26
these ads it doesn't mean that they are the relevant audience to purchase the product so I will probably want to try
11:30:34
two different angles here one is to Target the interest as we did here and the second is to go really Broad and not
11:30:43
choose any interest interest at all now this will be a more expensive attempt to find our audiences but this way they're
11:30:50
also not really going to be hiding anywhere but we will spend more money in the beginning that's why Tik Tok
11:30:55
Facebook and other platforms want you to go super Broad in the beginning because if you narrow down to much I mean there
11:31:00
are pros and there are cons right if you narrow down you may be targeting the Right audience but you may also be
11:31:06
missing the rest of the people who could be buying your products who don't have these specific interests written on
11:31:11
their profiles or on their social media platforms so if you spend more money in the beginning and you go super AB Brad now
11:31:18
the platform is shooting it to pretty much anyone anywhere right and when they start getting traffic when you when
11:31:24
people start to click on the ad and go to your website then Tik Tok or whatever platform you're advertising on is like
11:31:30
okay this guy clicked this guy clicked this guy clicked and oh this guy added to C that's even more important because
11:31:36
our goal is uh to check out right it's to convert and this guy actually converted this guy checked out and he
11:31:42
purchased the product so let's see what these people's interests are and we'll try to continue now to look for more
11:31:49
people with similar interests to the ones that actually engaged in the ad and moved towards the goal that we have set
11:31:56
in our campaign but to find these people in the beginning is going to take some time and before the algorithm starts to
11:32:01
work on the driven data that you're able to give it it's going to shoot the ad everywhere and in the beginning it's
11:32:07
going to spend your money not knowing exactly which audience to look for but once it starts to find them it will
11:32:14
start getting better and better with the data so I want to try two different approaches here I will Target the 7 to 8
11:32:20
million people with the pets interest and I will probably run another ad the
11:32:26
same exact ad only without choosing any interest whatsoever it's going to be
11:32:31
more expensive I do have a budget for this so I don't mind testing it so that you don't have to but I am interested to
11:32:37
see how much more it's going to cost and how much better the data that I get is going to be once algorithm starts to
11:32:44
work and find results okay so we are going to continue we've got this on a I
11:32:51
think it was $20 daily but this is just for the ad group we still haven't worked on the ad that's going to get its own
11:32:57
daily budget which can be smaller and then this daily budget spreads out through the ads that I will create soon
11:33:04
okay so everything else is fine we can finally click on continue all right next use Smart creative to create ads smart
11:33:11
creative ensures your ad groups are continuously optimized by autogenerating videos that are Diversified across ad
11:33:17
creative asset selection and more no thank you leave out all of the smart and automatic things when it comes to
11:33:22
running ads we already talked about that all right the creative name this is going to be we are now working on the ad
11:33:28
by the way okay so remember that we have three groups the first group is the campaign all right so this is the broad campaign that we're launching around
11:33:34
what product what Niche whatever and then we have the ad group okay so just to get back the campaign pretty much
11:33:40
sets the goals of the whole campaign and what we're trying to do the ad group or the ad set here we're doing the audience
11:33:46
targeting the demographics and the interests and all of that and then now
11:33:51
in the ad and it's all connected one another of course now the ad is the actual creative what are you showing all
11:33:58
of these people that you're targeting in the ad group with the goal that we set in the whole campaign now of course you
11:34:04
can have multiple ads connected to one ad set connected to one campaign you can
11:34:09
have multiple ads connected to multiple ad sets connected to one campaign or even multiple campaigns so it's like a
11:34:14
web and it can keep going on and on but in the beginning of course we are going to start simple one campaign one ad
11:34:20
group maybe another ad group when I choose um more broad targeting and now we're going to create the creatives so
11:34:27
the first creative name each video is going to be its own creative so the first one is going to be what is first
11:34:32
place here on uh YouTube that got almost 2,000 views so it's this one my cats are
11:34:38
in love with this product I just want to remember exactly which video this is my cats are in love with this new grooming
11:34:43
brush in love with this new grooming this is the uh video that starts like that so let's look for that one uh so
11:34:50
pet team brush exports my cats are in love with this new grooming brush so
11:34:56
let's see which video started like that this is I can't believe nobody told me about this calling all four
11:35:04
parents it's furry spot time every pet parent needs this brush so it's the last
11:35:10
creative my cats are in love with this new growing brush okay so it's it's pet steam brush 5 this is the one that
11:35:16
performed the best this is the first add creative that I'm going to add so the creative name is my cats are in love
11:35:24
with this grooming brush okay so next we have the identity now we don't want to
11:35:30
use Tik Tok account to deliver spark ads leave that off but the identity is important now you do see that this C I
11:35:35
have this candy Cube sling bag because it's a previous ad that I ran on Tik Tok and this is not the one that we're going to use we're going to create a new
11:35:41
custom identity this is what we see right here so this is like the username that we'll see on the creative and so we
11:35:47
can use whatever identity that we want okay so I'm going to click on create new identity and we're going to call this
11:35:52
one firmest Trio because that is the name of the product going to click on
11:35:58
create okay so now you can see it right here firmus Trio and this is the identity that we are going to go with
11:36:03
okay so continue scrolling down so now the ad details so the first the add format it's a single video you can also
11:36:09
do Carousel images but of course we're going with videos they usually work better and the add creative so now we're
11:36:14
just going to upload the video right here so I'm going to click on upload and we are on pet steam brush
11:36:21
5 okay ready to upload click on continue okay nice and simple so now while it's
11:36:27
uploading we're going to continue now the ad text so let's see what are the ad texts that we added to the YouTube video
11:36:33
my cats are in love with this new brush and that's pretty much it then just hashtags that we don't really need in
11:36:38
the uh ad copy itself so I could go with the same text I could generate something else I can get get help from chat GPT
11:36:44
but I think it sounds pretty good my cats are in love with this new brush get
11:36:50
yours now with fast shipping okay so we can see the text right here my cats are in love with this new brush get yours
11:36:56
now with fast shipping okay now the call to action so here you can choose what call to action to add and the call to
11:37:02
action is what you're seeing here in the button so which text do you want here order now get yours now and all of these
11:37:09
now if you keep it all if you keep all of these here like all of these in then Tik Tok will show different call to
11:37:15
actions to different audiences and it'll kind of see which one works best so I don't mind doing that but I don't want
11:37:21
the ones that are not relevant okay like for example learn more we don't need that we're not here to learn anything
11:37:27
we're here to make an impulse purchase so order now get yours now order yours today maybe that one's a little bit long
11:37:34
I haven't ever used such call to actions order yours now uh buy today order here shop today maybe not shop today buy here
11:37:41
and not check it out okay so that's it I don't mind checking out those order now is also enough you can just go with one
11:37:47
but I don't mind doing some AB testing okay next we've got interactive addons um I don't really recommend it could
11:37:54
work but I don't want to make it too messy I want them to focus on the ad copy on the text on the product and not
11:37:59
on other things that will suddenly uh pop up so I don't mind leaving that one off next destination so to a URL or to a
11:38:06
Tik Tok instant page we already know the answer to that one now remember that this needs to link to the product page
11:38:12
not to your homepage page not to some collection this needs to lead to the product page of the product that we are
11:38:18
trying to sell so here as we know it's firm is Trio so let's go back to our website let's click on the product okay
11:38:25
here it is copy the URL head back to the ads manager and
11:38:31
paste it over here okay great now you can click on preview and I suggest doing it just to
11:38:37
make sure that you added the right link this is important because if you don't click on the right link if you don't put in the right link you're sending your
11:38:43
audience to somewhere else and you pretty much messed up everything that you worked hard for up until now so
11:38:48
don't mess that one up all right I really like the product page it really really looks great all right next we're
11:38:54
going to continue scrolling down all right leave everything here un clicked continue all right so tracking optional
11:39:00
we might as well track because we do have the pixel so the website events is going to use the pixel and you can leave the offline and app events and
11:39:07
everything else third party tracking settings leave everything off as is and that's it we're pretty much ready with
11:39:14
this ad this is what it's going to look like my cats are in love with this new grooming okay so as we know we've got the ferace trio here here you know what
11:39:21
let me just remove uh Trio because I think the two T's just might not look that good so let's just create one more
11:39:27
identity and this time let's just call it firest there we go yeah it looks a
11:39:33
little bit better okay so everything looks good we're good to go so now I'm going to click on publish all and it's going to start running the ad for this
11:39:40
product and it's going to keep running continuously until I turn it off and the budget that it's going to use is the budget that I chose in the ad group one
11:39:47
step before this so remember that I put down $20 so it's going to put down $20 on this ad right here but if I create
11:39:53
another ad another creative inside that ad group then it's going to split the budget between those two ads and of
11:39:58
course that is what I actually want to do so I want to upload the top three creatives for this uh product and if I
11:40:04
don't see any nice results by tomorrow or in two days from now then I'm going to turn off these ads and I'm going to
11:40:10
duplicate what I did I'm going to duplicate the ad group under the same campaign and I'm going to go super broad with the audience interest as I
11:40:16
mentioned cuz I do want to test that one out as well I do believe that if we put more budget in the beginning and we go
11:40:23
more broad we will be able to find better results rather than trying to narrow it down right from the start
11:40:28
because we don't really have the data we don't really have all the insights for the people that we are trying to Target
11:40:33
okay so I'm going to try both directions and if I see that it's not working again well I'm going to show you how I'm going
11:40:39
to turn off the ads and create a new one only this time we're going to go super broad I'm going to put more of a budget
11:40:44
into it and do all of this testing for you guys so that you don't have to all right so let's go ahead and publish this one so I'm going to click here on
11:40:50
publish all and it looks like I missed out
11:40:57
something because it took me now to this page Let's see we got an error an activated optimization event is required
11:41:04
Oh I thought that we did that our optimization event should be to check out let's see so we got it right here
11:41:09
you can see exactly where the error is cuz they'll highlight it in red and this is be low where we chose the data connection for the pixel and by the way
11:41:16
this is pretty new it didn't H I didn't have the whole mandatory pixel when I ran ads on Tik Tok up until now so let's
11:41:22
click on optimization event and here we have a whole bunch of events that are related to checking out so add payment
11:41:27
info add to card complete payment initiate checkout and search view content so of course what we're looking
11:41:33
here is for complete payment it's it's not enough if someone just adds to card or adds payment info or initiates the
11:41:40
checkout I need them to complete the payment that means that they finished paying for the product and they actually
11:41:46
purchased it okay so we're done narrow down audience let's now go ahead and click on publish all and now another
11:41:53
error wow daily budget must be at least $30 they opted from 20 to 30 I cannot believe it okay let's go with 30 guys
11:42:00
this is money that we need to spend it's fine we need to Market out our products and it's weird that they did change it
11:42:06
from 20 to 30 because just the other day it was 20 but okay Tik Tok needs more
11:42:12
money and anyway these are the funds that we're going to spend anyway we're not going to spend anything less than this but remember that it's not going to
11:42:18
spend $30 on one creative it's going to spend it throughout the creatives that we create in under this campaign so of
11:42:24
course I'm going to upload more creatives and the budget is going to be split between them okay so I'll start with 30 because I will have three
11:42:31
creatives here so that's $10 per creative per day and I think that that is the sweet spot for Gathering the
11:42:38
first amount of data and seeing what we're going to do with it if it's good or if we should move to another type of
11:42:43
strategy okay so now we shouldn't get any errors let's click on publish all it's funny how things change so fast all
11:42:50
right so we can see now that it's creating the ad okay ad created and in review remember how I mentioned that Tik
11:42:56
Tok needs to review the ads usually just takes a few hours um nothing longer than that and yeah this is the first one
11:43:02
right here so this is that copy I don't know why they left the file name but uh my cats are in love with this uh
11:43:07
grooming brush so that is the first copy and you can see here that it's in review okay so now we're looking at the ad
11:43:14
under the ad group under the campaign okay so we can see that it the campaign
11:43:20
is active but it's not running yet because we do have an ad group that's not delivering it's in review along with
11:43:27
the ad itself so what we want to do now is I'm going to duplicate the ad twice
11:43:33
so that I could put the other two creatives that we have for this product so I'm going to click here on
11:43:40
copy and now you can see that it's asking me where I want to copy the ad to so to this existing campaign to the
11:43:46
existing ad group so this is fine let's click on copy okay and now I'm working
11:43:51
on the second ad and now I don't have to do the whole targeting again and the campaign objectives I'm just running
11:43:56
another ad really quickly under the same settings that I had until now so now let's add the second video the second
11:44:02
video that performed the best let's see this one this is the only pet brush
11:44:07
you'll need let's see what it has inside the creative I can't yeah it's I can't
11:44:14
believe nobody told me about this I think this was the first one the first uh creative that we made and this was
11:44:19
through uh cap cut okay so I can't believe no one told me about this okay
11:44:27
same identity only this time we're just going to change the video so I'm going to click here on update from computer
11:44:34
and let's just make sure that it's that first creative yeah I can't believe
11:44:39
nobody told me about this so it's pet steam brush one
11:44:46
okay ready to upload click continue okay now it's uploading the first
11:44:53
creative okay here we go and now the text why didn't anyone tell me about
11:45:01
this amazing brush get yours now with fast shipping okay three lines that's too much so just this then why didn't
11:45:10
anyone tell me about this get yours now with fast shipping um no I'm going to change that sentence
11:45:16
because on the one hand you're saying you're kind of like reviewing the product and then you're trying to sell it so let's try to make it less uh I'm
11:45:23
trying to sell it to you so the pet brush you didn't know needed get yours
11:45:30
now with fast shipping and here I don't want shop Noah arrivals hold on let's CH change the call to action oh my God I
11:45:37
cannot click on anything okay so we're going to go with get yours now
11:45:43
order here and that's enough okay so it's leading to the same page and everything
11:45:49
else is fine so we're going to click on publish all okay and while it's creating this ad now we're going to see another
11:45:56
ad so let's go to the campaign and under the same campaign we're still going to have one add group but now we're going to have two add copies so then again if
11:46:03
I click on the add group it's just one add group one campaign three ads or two
11:46:09
ads right now we're going to add the third one soon so two ads that are connected to the same settings in the ad
11:46:14
grouping campaign okay so we pretty much understand how this works now let's move on to the third video that worked well
11:46:20
under the Fus product so the next one in line is give your furry friend a special
11:46:26
spa day so this is the creative that started with it's furry spot it's furry spot time introducing okay it's furry
11:46:34
spot time is the third and final one that we are going to advertise okay so we're just going to hover over one of
11:46:40
these ads doesn't matter which again we're going to click on copy okay same campaign same ad group click
11:46:45
on copy so let's see which creative that is it's not the second it's furry Spa
11:46:51
time so it's the third one it's furry Spa time okay and again
11:46:59
we're leaving everything as is just uploading the video changing the video and the text below so this time we said
11:47:05
it's pet steam brush three right yes
11:47:13
click on continue and it's furry spot time
11:47:21
so give your pets the spa day they deserve get yours now with fast shipping
11:47:27
that's going to be the text and again the call to actions no shop no arrivals
11:47:32
get yours buy today order yours uh buy here no need shop today no need check it
11:47:39
out earn more all right that is fine and everything else as we know is great so
11:47:44
we're going to click on publish all and as you see it gets easier and easier the more you do it okay so that one is created go back
11:47:51
to the campaigns now if I notice that these three are not performing as well as I'd
11:47:58
like then as I mentioned after a day or two I might just turn off these ads and go super Broad and if I do go there then
11:48:05
I'm going to upload all five videos I'm going to put more of a budget and I'm going to let the algorithm really start
11:48:10
working from the top and find all its way down to the bottom where our target
11:48:16
audience resides so I already mentioned the pros and the cons of that I do believe in both methods it really depends on how much of a budget you have
11:48:23
so again if you don't have that much you don't want to put that much in the beginning you want to see some returns first try a more narrow down approach
11:48:29
just to see faster results but if you do have that budget if you can test it more go a little bit more abroad and see how
11:48:36
that works for you and test all of your copies let organic work let PPC work and let the magic start to work so here I'm
11:48:42
just going to leave it like this three copies narrow down and we'll see in a day or two if we're going to continue with this approach or try the more broad
11:48:49
the more expensive one but the one that should give us more results further down the road all right so it's nice to be
11:48:54
doing all of this testing so we are done with the Fus Trio now we need to run the same ads for the second product for the
11:49:01
alarm door stopper so for that we're going to have to create a new campaign only it will be relatively similar to
11:49:08
the one that we just created it's still going to have the same goals and all of that so what I will do is I will duplicate the campaign but I will change
11:49:15
the ad group because the audience targeting doesn't need pet interests and of course the ads in the end are going
11:49:20
to be the ad creatives are going to be different as well okay so what we're going to do now is simply duplicate the campaign so I clicked here on campaign
11:49:27
and I'm going to hover over the campaign and click on copy to create the duplicate okay so here it's website conversions and the campaign name is not
11:49:34
going to be from M Trio it's going to be alert Guard Pro now I'm going to click on continue I'm not going to publish
11:49:41
because then it's going to publish uh everything else that was copied which we don't want to copy so keep in mind that
11:49:46
we do need to make changes because it copied the campaign the ad groups and the uh creatives in the end so we're
11:49:52
just going to make changes where changes need to be made so here the ad group name is alert Guard Pro okay the pixel
11:50:00
is fine optimization event as we mentioned is complete payment the playment the placements are also going
11:50:05
to stay the same and here the demographics are also fine it's the United States the age range for the door
11:50:12
alarm stop stopper wait did we do 25 didn't we do 18 to 45 or 54 hold on let
11:50:17
me go back to the previous campaign really quick let me go back to the ferace trio campaign and let's see what
11:50:23
we did there um this was the ad group so here you can just hover and click on
11:50:29
edit and let's see what we did with the age range here oh we didn't we didn't choose 18 we actually do want 18 until
11:50:37
54 okay good thing that I duplicated the campaign and noticed that mistake so now we're going to save it now it's going to
11:50:43
send it to review from the beginning which is fine we have time but now let's go back to the campaign that we were
11:50:49
actually working on now and also choose 18 um this makes sense 18 to 54 for the
11:50:55
security of the door alarm stopper gender all language English everything else stays the same except for the
11:51:01
audience interests now here in terms of interests
11:51:09
this can stay broad I'm going to keep this one super super broad because
11:51:15
anyone can use this anyone that lives in a home anyone that travels from the ages
11:51:21
of 18 to 55 can all use this product so I really don't have a specific interest
11:51:27
in mind and I will keep this one super super broad so I know that in the beginning it's not going to give me a
11:51:33
lot of good results but it will start to slowly find my audiences so let's try that approach here CU again it is a use
11:51:41
case for pretty much any person in the world who has a door in their day-to-day life and are also interested in their
11:51:48
own security which should be pretty much everyone around the world okay so we're going to leave this super super Broad
11:51:55
and everything else stays the same so now I'm going to click on continue be careful not to click on publish all by
11:52:00
mistake because it's going to publish the copied versions that we didn't change yet so it's going to publish the
11:52:06
three pet steam brushes even though those are not the products that we are going with here okay so what I'm going to do here is change each one of these
11:52:13
ads to the ones that we actually want to use so the first thing that we're going to change of course is the creative name
11:52:19
so here the first video that performed well for the door stopper is secure your door and stay safe let's see which that
11:52:27
this one is the one that we created from uh D Vinci resolve so I bought this for my mother who was traveling alone that's
11:52:32
going to be the first video here so the creative name is I bought this for my mother the creative name is internal
11:52:39
your audience are not going to see that okay next the custom identity of course we're going to create a new one here cuz it's not firmest so it's alert guard
11:52:46
let's see if Pro yeah Pro can also fit in here yeah it's readable okay so
11:52:52
that's the identity and again single video we're just going to update the video and now instead of pet steam brush
11:52:58
we are on alarm door stopper exports and let's see which one we're
11:53:03
looking at now it's not this one I can tell because
11:53:09
of the text it was this one see if I have anything else that looks similar no it wasn't
11:53:16
this okay so it's um alert Guard Pro one it's the first one that we worked on
11:53:21
actually all right so alert Guard Pro one
11:53:27
continue and now I'm just going to change the first sentence so keep your
11:53:32
family and yourself safe get yours now with fast shipping okay so alert Guard
11:53:38
Pro keep your family and yourself safe get yours now with fast shipping and the call to actions even though you
11:53:44
duplicate it it looks like they're changing it aren't they see I don't want to learn more and check it out so when
11:53:50
you duplicate they kind of change this okay everything else besides of
11:53:55
course the product page make sure to review yourself and that you're not making any mistakes CU again that's
11:54:01
going to cost you all the work that you did up until now so now let's take the URL for the aler guard pro copy
11:54:09
it paste it right here preview to make sure that you added the right link looks
11:54:14
great and everything else is good except for the other AD copies ad creatives
11:54:19
right here right so we need to change them as well so before I publish we need to change the other ads so I'm going to
11:54:25
click here on the second ad now you don't have to duplicate if you think that this is too confusing and you might leave something out just create a new
11:54:31
campaign and select all the settings all over again it doesn't matter which one you go with as long as you're not making
11:54:36
mistakes and you're not leaving anything out okay so they're created for the second one let's see what the second video is that we're going to go with
11:54:43
lock your door wherever you go and stay safe so it was this one right here there are two burglaries also through um I'm
11:54:51
amazed this is also through the Vinci resolve this wasn't through cap cut it doesn't have a AI text to speech okay so
11:54:57
it was this one there are two burglaries every two minutes in the us alone this one I tried to start with like a fact
11:55:03
that kind of you know makes people kind of like you know shock like wow that much and they want to continue on to the
11:55:08
next uh screen and this is where I just acted as a thief as a rubber okay so
11:55:14
let's see which one that is it was this one alert Guard Pro
11:55:20
3 okay so first let's change the video so we won't forget
11:55:29
it alert Guard Pro 3 continue all right now let's go back up so the identity
11:55:34
here is alert Guard Pro the creative name is 1 million burglaries every two
11:55:43
minutes okay and lock your door wherever you go and stay safe that's where I wrote there we
11:55:50
can write something similar lock your door wherever you and stay safe okay and
11:55:57
it's still under two lines no three lines now so I want to make it two lines I don't want to make it too much go and
11:56:04
stay safe so I'm going to leave now so get yours with fast shipping there we go
11:56:10
okay call to action again just leave out whatever is not really that
11:56:17
relevant and the URL again preview all right and everything
11:56:25
else is great move on to the third and final one okay so who was our third best
11:56:33
performer um these two are actually pretty close but let's go with the one that one so keep the bad guys away what
11:56:40
is the creative here I this from my mom who was traveling alone so this one again which as we saw worked really well
11:56:45
for a seller who I actually took this um sentence from I thought I changed it to
11:56:51
Sister oh no he went with sister I went with Mom just to make a little bit different um so this is the same creative and he kept using that creative
11:56:57
over and over again I bought this for my sister I bought this for my sister who was traveling alone because that is the copy that worked well for him and I can
11:57:02
see that organically it's working pretty well for us as well so it's a pretty good copy um this one was done on cap
11:57:09
cut so we know which video to choose let's see which one it is here in
11:57:16
order I think it's probably the second one yeah I bought this for my mom okay
11:57:22
so it's the second one alert Guard Pro too identity is alert Guard Pro video is
11:57:29
alert card Pro
11:57:35
to keep the bad guys away wherever you go let's use that one keep the bad guys
11:57:41
away away wherever you go go get yours now with fast shipping two lines looks good again call two
11:57:51
actions and the product page URL preview always always preview even
11:57:59
if you're 200% sure and that's it so alert Guard Pro 1 three and two are the
11:58:05
copies that we're going with everything else is set up correctly except for the creative name so I bought this for my
11:58:14
mom cap cut I'll call it cuz the previous one was uh the Vinci and okay
11:58:20
we're good to go let's do it click on publish all and we just really quickly created another campaign based off of
11:58:26
the initial settings that we created on the first campaign and just made the necessary adjustments like the uh
11:58:32
audience interests the ad copies the creatives the texts and the videos okay so back to campaigns now you will see
11:58:39
that we have two campaigns running so if I click on campaign you can see two campaigns one is alert Guard Pro the
11:58:45
other is Fus Trio and if I click on ADD group you can see that oh Fus Trio
11:58:50
already got uh reviewed but I still need to add balance this is the next section that I wanted to do before I finalize uh
11:58:56
the Tik Tok ad so you see right here ad bons to get your account running before running ads so what happened here is it
11:59:03
already finished the review you see that alert Guard Pro is in review because we just submitted it this moment but for
11:59:10
Miss Trio it didn't take a few hours it took a few minutes it's not even in review anymore it passed the review but there is no payment settings so there's
11:59:16
no payment balance so it's not going to run so we've got two ad groups two campaigns and a total of six ad
11:59:23
creatives so you can see that the three pet team brushes they finish a review and the three alert guard Pros are under
11:59:28
review right now as soon as I finish submitting my balance adding my balance these are going to run and these will
11:59:34
run once the review session is complete now you can choose what you want to see so for example if I only have this one
11:59:40
ticked in then I'll go to ad groups then I'll only see alert Guard Pro okay and then in the campaign I'll only see alert
11:59:46
Guard Pro in the ads because that's what I chose in the campaign if I choose only firmus Trio then I'll only see that ad
11:59:54
group as we can see right here and that ad creatives that has to do with ferace Trio okay so just so you kind of know
12:00:00
how to navigate around this and you can see that they're both active if you toggle this off it'll turn off The
12:00:05
Campaign which will turn off the ad groups that are connected to that Campaign which will turn off the ad creatives that are connected to that
12:00:11
campaign so you can turn it off from here you can turn it off from the ad group so let's say I have multiple ad
12:00:16
groups under the same campaign I want to leave some of them on turn some of them off you can do it from here as well and
12:00:21
also from the ads I want to keep the campaigns I want to keep the ad groups but these ads are not performing well so I'm just going to toggle them off here
12:00:27
and I'm going to leave these on right here now I'm going to teach you about this whole analyzing these ads and how to move forward on the best performers
12:00:33
and how to turn off the Bad performers and how to continue multiplying and scaling the good performers and I'm
12:00:39
going to go through everything that we see here the cost cpcs CPM Impressions all of these code words this different
12:00:44
language that you're seeing here I'm going to walk you through all of that but we're going to have to see some numbers first all right so let's go
12:00:50
ahead and add some balance and this is taking me to the payment settings okay so I've got zero available balance let's
12:00:56
go ahead and add a balance and let's see if I'm running $30
12:01:02
per day on two different products so that is $60 a day because I'm testing out two different products and I want to
12:01:08
keep it going for a few days at least so I'm going to top it up with $200 in balance and that should give me at least
12:01:16
3 days to test out and see how it's going to go so let's go with 200 and I
12:01:21
know it may seem like a lot to you you don't have to put so much money especially on multiple products so you
12:01:28
can only test one product out each time and kind of play around with it just CU you're putting a daily budget doesn't
12:01:33
mean you need to also use all of it see what the data is able to give you but also do let your ads run for at least 2
12:01:39
to 3 days before deciding what to do because once you start to actually accumulate data that is good for you and
12:01:44
it doesn't happen from the first day usually that is when things are going to start kicking off for you and when
12:01:50
you're going to start getting a return on your investment so take all these things into consideration okay let me just add those
12:01:56
$200 okay I already have my credit card uh put inside so I don't have to enter it again so I'm just going to click on
12:02:03
make payment Payment Processing payment successful and we are good to go
12:02:12
okay so if I go back to the ads let's go ahead and refresh this campaign page so
12:02:17
we can see that the campaigns are not in review anymore they're not only active but they're also starting to run right
12:02:24
now as we speak so good luck to our two products on Tik Tok ads now I'm going to
12:02:30
also do the same thing on Facebook ads just so that you can learn the difference between these two platforms decide which one is best for you if you
12:02:36
have a lot of budget jump into both of them start having fun with the data because Facebook Facebook is also a
12:02:42
really good platform to run your ads on it's been doing wonders for drop shippers for years now Tik Tok is the
12:02:48
new kid on the blog so they do have access to a lot of fresh young audiences but Facebook has a lot of older
12:02:55
audiences people who usually have more of a budget they're older and they also have more purchasing power so I do like
12:03:01
to play around on both platforms because both give sells at the end of the day and I want you also to see the
12:03:06
differences between them and make the best decision for your business so good luck with our Tik Tok and ad I'm going
12:03:12
to update you one or two days from now if we're going to continue running these narrow down audiences or go to a more
12:03:18
broad audience just like we did with alert Guard Pro we may do the same with ferus Trio so let's just see we're doing
12:03:24
a lot of AB testing at the moment and now that we're done with Tik Tok ads we're going to see the results of that soon let's move over to Facebook
12:03:30
campaigns and create our Facebook ads similar to what we did here on Tik Tok all right so with Facebook ads or meta
12:03:37
ads it's going to be a little bit easier because we already have the creatives on our Facebook page and it could have also
12:03:43
been the same for Tik Tok only I had the issue where I lost account to my Tik Tok account so then I had just had to you
12:03:49
know reupload uh the videos there but I already had the data from the organic uh marketing that I did on YouTube so
12:03:55
anyway if you do not have a Facebook business account or a meta business suit as they call it now just go ahead and
12:04:01
create one it's free just fill in your information your personal or business information add your payment setting so
12:04:07
that you can pay for the ads and that's pretty much it that's all there is to it so you got the pay right here I added
12:04:12
the link to it inside the cheat sheet remember that everything that I'm going over is all inside the Shopify cheat
12:04:18
sheet for access to it all you got to do is comment right below this video # Shopify let me know what is your top
12:04:24
takeaway from this video what did you learn from it and I will happily send you this cheat sheet with all of the links all of the resources inside all
12:04:31
right so once you create your madeup business suit your madeup business account you're going to be greeted with your meta suit page which looks like
12:04:38
this and here you have access to all of your pages so if if you remember correctly you created a page most likely
12:04:44
under your personal Facebook account which is fine you can create as many pages as you want and then when you create or made a business suit it's
12:04:50
going to be connected to your Facebook profile and all of the pages that you have connected to your Facebook profile
12:04:57
so here I've got the prime jungle page I created this one with you guys you guys saw every step of the way so it's
12:05:02
already connected of course to my madeup business suit and now what we're going to do is start running ads from this
12:05:08
page now because we already uploaded the reels we already have the insights on what worked better what didn't work as
12:05:14
well even though YouTube gave us better results so we will go with the results that we got from YouTube but we do not have to re-upload the reals here because
12:05:21
they're already uploaded on our page which in this case is prime jungle so I already have the videos uploaded here
12:05:27
it's going to be much easier for me to run ads so let's go ahead and do that so the first thing that we're going to do is make sure that we're on our Facebook
12:05:34
page where we uploaded the videos and we're going to click here on create ad you can also do it by clicking here on
12:05:40
ads on the left side and create ads right here on the top right okay so let's start with the campaign goals now
12:05:46
you guys are well aware of this how to go about it only Facebook's selections are a little bit different than Tik Tok
12:05:52
so here here are the goals that we have on Facebook get more messages compare to different ads boost Facebook content
12:05:59
promote your page get more calls so none of this is really relevant except for get more website visitors even though
12:06:06
our top goal is not just to get a visitor it's to have them check out and complete purchase but Facebook doesn't
12:06:11
have have that goal right from the top so here you can play with two different things one you can boost Facebook
12:06:17
content so this is the content that I already uploaded to Facebook I want you to find as many people as you can that
12:06:23
will engage with this post that will like it share it so that the post will start getting a lot of engagements and
12:06:29
will hopefully go viral and so when other people land on this post they'll see that a lot of people engage with it so it's probably a good post and they'll
12:06:35
have more trust authority to move forward click on the call to action and proceed to the product page so this you
12:06:41
can do by boosting Facebook content you can just put $5 per day just for like 2 3 days you'll have a lot of likes your
12:06:47
post will start to go viral I do not have that luxury of time at the moment so I will go directly to get more
12:06:54
website visitors both methods can work I'm not saying you have to start with Boost Facebook content but it will give
12:06:59
you more social proof more engagements on your post and it's really really cheap to do so I'm going to go with get more website visitors okay so we have
12:07:06
the goal right here we're creating a new ad so the ad creative we can just use one of the post that we already have
12:07:12
right cuz we already created the posts here so I'm going to click here on use a post and here are all of the videos that
12:07:18
we uploaded to Facebook re so we should have about 10 reals here five for each product and again we're going to have to
12:07:24
start to choose the ones that work the best for us so again back to YouTube that has all the info that we need the
12:07:31
first video that worked really well I I really wish again that it could have been Tik Tok but you guys know what happened there and I hope that you guys
12:07:37
keep your information don't forget your passwords don't get bugged out of Tik Tok and used them for organic marketing
12:07:42
as well I really wish it would have worked for this example but in this case YouTube worked in your case if you've got great results on Tik Tok great
12:07:49
results on YouTube you can choose which ones you want to boost and put your budget on but in my case we are staying
12:07:55
with YouTube okay so the first one was this one right here so it was my cats are in love with this new grooming brush
12:08:03
so I think that was pet steam brush 3 if I'm not
12:08:09
mistaken no the fifth one yeah okay so pet steam brush five okay
12:08:15
so that is the one that worked but we're not uploading again so let's just go back to the maup business suit we just
12:08:20
need to choose that creative which is this one right here my cats are in love
12:08:26
with this new brush so we're going to go with this one this is the post that we want to go for so I'm going to click
12:08:32
here on use post so here add a headline in a description so here I'm going to
12:08:37
call it my cats are in love with this new brush get yours now with fast shipping okay and the headline Prime
12:08:44
jungle best deals online fast delivery to your doorstep I want to see how that's going to look like before we
12:08:50
decide if we want to change it okay so right here you've got the text here my cats are in love with this new brush get yours now with fast shipping and then
12:08:56
you've got Prime jungle best deals online fast delivery two and then it gets cut off so I don't want to have all
12:09:02
of that headline um we're already writing fast delivery uh here in the description so
12:09:09
Prime jungle best deals online let's change it to around the same things that
12:09:15
we have on our website so our slogan was wild value Untamed quality let's go with
12:09:22
something along the lines of that okay so now they're giving us only 25 character so we can't write that much
12:09:28
so it's going to be wild value Untamed quality nope we can't add all of that
12:09:35
it's weird it looks like there's more room but they're now limiting it to only 25 so let's make it only up to 25
12:09:40
characters spoil your furry friend so it's not
12:09:45
about us it's just a little humor and we're going to add that sounds nice
12:09:51
sounds friendly see what it looks like once it loads here the add preview okay my cat turn up with this new brush get
12:09:57
yours now with fast shipping and then they've got the video here and they can click here spoil your furry friend Prime
12:10:03
jungle. Star and we're definitely going to change the call to action we don't want apply now um there are three
12:10:09
examples that it's showing because it depends if they're seeing it on a Facebook reel or on a Facebook post on
12:10:14
the feed so it's going to look different depending on what format they see it on um so we're going to change a button
12:10:20
label for sure and it's going to be shop now now under contact method if you want
12:10:25
you can add your WhatsApp number I'm not going to do it in my case but this way customers reach out to you even before
12:10:31
they purchase now here under Advantage Plus creative leverage Facebook's data to automatically deler deliver different
12:10:36
ad creativ variations to people who When likely to improve performance I'm I'm not going to leave that on I'm going to
12:10:42
turn it off again this is more of those uh oh um you know Advantage Plus they're going to call it Tik Tok calls it
12:10:48
something else plus I forgot what they called it so we're not going to use all of these AI tools to find better audiences because at the end I'm looking
12:10:54
for someone who will purchase not just someone who will likely improve performance of my ad like the engagements or something I'm going for a
12:11:00
specific goal and I don't want you to try and mess around with that special ad category we can leave that off cuz we're
12:11:06
not doing anything that's related to credit employment housing and so forth and so here audience who should see see
12:11:11
your ad so again we did turn off the Advantage Plus so we don't want that here I am going to choose people you
12:11:18
choose through targeting and here we are going to change our audience interests and the demographics and all of that so
12:11:26
here we can go from 18 to 55 even though people in pension can also buy at 65
12:11:32
plus but not many of them are on Facebook so I'm going to keep it until 55 okay and the locations of course this
12:11:40
case is going to be the United States so while we do ship internationally again this is our target
12:11:45
audience and when we go abroad we can go worldwide if I decide to go super broad
12:11:50
with my um ad copies and super broad interests I'm also going to go super broad worldwide but again that's going
12:11:57
to be very very costly until it starts to find the right audiences who will buy because there's a lot of countries that it needs to Target a lot of people that
12:12:04
needs to show the ads to and that is going to cost whatever it will and it's also going to take time but again this
12:12:10
is the best way to get the right data that's relevant for your target audience and your product and all of that okay
12:12:16
next now we need to choose the audience interests so here it's around the same interest that we added like um pets pet
12:12:23
lovers and all of that so here I'm just going to keep it mainly broad but I do want people who have some interest in
12:12:30
pets okay so pets animals right here I'm going to choose that interest so right here we can see if we are on a broad
12:12:36
audience right now we're looking at around 187 to 220 million so it's super super broad now Facebook sees it as
12:12:43
fairly broad you know you should keep it around here I'm not going to keep it around here it's way too many people and
12:12:50
I do want to narrow it down just a bit more okay maybe not to two million but I still want to narrow it down some more
12:12:57
okay so we can also click on browse to get more insights on how to Target our audiences because as you guys know I
12:13:02
didn't use the audience research spreadsheet I'm moving forward really fast I hope that you guys will use it
12:13:07
but let me see what insights we can get from here because it can all be relevant at the end of the day so demographics
12:13:14
doesn't really matter to me um lots of people can have pets lots of people can show this ad to their parents or whoever
12:13:20
who can purchase this product for them so next here under interests we can go
12:13:25
to hobbies and activities and here we've got home and garden pets animals we can
12:13:31
click on that and let's go with cats and dogs and that's it I'm going to leave it
12:13:37
pretty broad from here because so many people can have pets in their homes and I don't want to narrow it down too much
12:13:43
like we did on uh Tik Tok even though there we're still looking around 7 to 8 million but maybe that was a little bit
12:13:49
too narrowed down I will see tomorrow after I get my first $10 in ad spend and
12:13:54
understand where that went for each video copy so I'm going to look at my first $30 spend for the pet product and
12:14:00
see if I should go more abroad with my interests as I already mentioned a few times I'm still not completely sure and
12:14:06
that's why we have to keep our eye on the ads on the data and understand where we want to go next okay and that's
12:14:13
pretty much it so I added the interests okay so once we're done here we're going to click on the back arrow okay so we
12:14:19
we're going to keep this fairly broad cats dogs and pets okay so we're looking at around 240 to 280 million let's see
12:14:25
the differences between Tik to 78 million to Facebook's 240 to 280 million now the answer is kind of obvious to me
12:14:33
I know that this one here is going to cost me a little bit more money until I start reaching information until I start
12:14:39
getting data from the money that I'm spending but because I'm starting super broad it's not going to miss out a lot
12:14:44
of audiences that are potential to purchase our product so I do think that this is a good approach as well and it's
12:14:50
better to start off here with a little bit of a higher budget just so that we know that we will get good results in a few days okay so I'm going to go ahead
12:14:57
and click on Save audience and we are doing a very nice AB testing between Facebook and Tik Tok now okay so we can
12:15:03
see it right here audience details United States 18 to 55 interest cats dogs or pets and what is this Advantage
12:15:09
Detail targeting on Advantage Detail targeting will now be applied Beyond
12:15:14
this to reach a broader audience I would like to turn it off but sadly Facebook
12:15:20
will not allow me but anyway we're we are going very very broad so it doesn't really matter okay so we're going to
12:15:25
start the ad now as soon as possible run continuously until I decide when to turn you off and now it's the budget now you
12:15:31
can start with a $5 a day daily budget you know Tik Tok does go a little bit higher than that um their minimum
12:15:37
currently is 30 even though it was 20 now it's 30 it can always change by the time you're watching this video it's probably something different um and they
12:15:44
will split it between all of your um ad creatives and here Facebook is looking at each ad creative asking you how much
12:15:51
do you want to spend on this specific creative not splitting the budget between other creatives so that's also
12:15:57
fine and even better because you can go as low as $5 in my case I do need to get the data a little bit faster so I will
12:16:03
go with $10 I don't want to jump too much overboard even if you do have a budget for it because not all of your
12:16:09
audiences who will purchase your product will be online on that day on that moment where they see the ad so you want to give them time to also go online so
12:16:16
find that sweet spot between your maximum budget to what is a good balance to spend on a day-to- day to make sure
12:16:23
that your audiences will be online when they see the ad and not just say okay let's just put one $100 run the ad for
12:16:29
one day and that's it I spend $100 I should see good results but in that one day they probably weren't online they
12:16:36
probably didn't see your ad okay so find that sweet spot I'm going to go with $10 and I'm going to put $10 on every video
12:16:43
okay so here we have the Advantage Plus placements let us maximize your budget across Facebook Messenger Instagram and
12:16:48
meta audience I do not want to do that so definitely turn that off even if they recommend it our only placements is
12:16:55
going to be Facebook no Instagram no messenger you could get some from Instagram as well and I'm not really
12:17:01
sure about messenger I've never gotten sales from there but Facebook is the best at this so I'm just going to leave it there okay and next last but not
12:17:08
least we have to connect our pixel so that we can get better data on the audiences that are coming in you guys are already well aware of what pixels
12:17:15
are and how they work and why we actually need them to reuse them to Target our audiences after we run ads
12:17:22
for a few days the pixel is already getting information now the pixel starts to know what to do okay I understand
12:17:28
what product you're trying to sell I understand what types of people are clicking on your ads and are getting to your product page now I can find
12:17:35
patterns on other people that we know about all over Facebook and I'm going to find those audiences and I'm going to
12:17:40
talk Target them with your ads instead of going super super broad okay so we will definitely connect a pixel so we're
12:17:46
going to toggle that on so I do have an old inactive pixel here so I do need to reactivate it or create a new one and
12:17:52
then we're going to select it from here so in order to do that we need to go to the Facebook events manager I added the
12:17:58
link to the Shopify cheat sheet you can also search for it on Google but this is what the events manager looks like and
12:18:03
here is where we can connect our pixel the events manager is connected to our Facebook account so again everything is
12:18:08
really easy to get to and here you can connect a new data source or see your current data sources this is the pixel
12:18:14
the data source same as it is on Tik Tok okay so I can click on data sources here because I already have my old pixel I
12:18:21
just need to reactivate it in your case you're going to connect a data source and connect it to the web because you're
12:18:27
connecting it to your website and just follow with a step-by-step process it's very similar to what we did on Tik Tok
12:18:33
only here it's not going to directly connect uh to your Shopify store but again it's a very easy step-by-step
12:18:38
process uh in my case I've already got my pixel here I just need to continue the pixel setup and you will go through
12:18:43
this as well so let's click on that and guys if you have any questions on anything that I'm going over in this
12:18:48
video it's very technical I know that we're going through a lot so just leave your questions down below and I will answer them and I will help you to the
12:18:55
best of my ability make it to the next step and understand how to make these connections work and happen Okay but on
12:19:00
the other hand I am showing you everything in this video but I'm sure things will come up things also change from time to time so feel free to speak
12:19:07
out let me know if you have any questions and I will answer okay so we're going to click here on continue pixel setup and here we can go with
12:19:14
manually add a pixel to the website or use partner integration same as we did on Tik Tok so I'm going to use that and
12:19:20
we're going to use Shopify and now it's going to want to add the app so here we need to install the Facebook and Instagram sales channel from Shopify so
12:19:27
let's go ahead and click here on go to Shopify and we're going to install Facebook and Instagram and this will
12:19:33
allow the pixel connection to be made with our Shopify store okay so again same as Tik Tok we're going to go ahead
12:19:39
and click on install okay now we're going to connect our account
12:19:46
continue okay so now that we install the Facebook and Instagram app on our Shopify store we need to take the next
12:19:52
step to be able to install the pixel now inside data sources is where we can connect to pixel so we either have an
12:19:59
existing pixel I have a few pixels I have a few business managers so for me everything is kind of scattered all over the place but uh here I've got uh two
12:20:06
pixels I rename one of them to uh Prime jungle uh business pixel and so if you don't have a pixel you're going to
12:20:12
create a new one right here from the data sources from the Facebook events manager so in order to do that you can
12:20:18
click right here on connect data source and you're going to go with web and you're going to create a new web data
12:20:24
source so here for my example it's called Prime jungle uh business pixel you can call it whatever you want and
12:20:29
continue with the process mine is already created because I'm going on a previous pixel that I had I haven't
12:20:34
really used it but I did create it so I just renamed the two prime jungles uh business pixel um it's very self-explain
12:20:40
you've already seen me creating a pixel on Tik Tok it's exactly the same on Facebook okay so here's where we're going to test the events and then we'll
12:20:46
see that the pixel is active when we're creating the ad so again guys if it's confusing don't worry about it just do
12:20:51
it one time and I promise that every time you do it after it will become much much easier and you can always feel free
12:20:57
to ask me questions Down Below in the comments okay so now I'm going to click here on test events and we want to make
12:21:02
sure that the pixel actually works so here I'm going to click on confirm your website's events are set up correctly
12:21:09
then we're going to put the URL to our store right here then open website okay now we're just going to do
12:21:15
a couple of things like click on this product so right now we're viewing content right let's go to the other one
12:21:21
view more content let's also do an add to card event let's also do an initiate
12:21:26
checkout event and now all of these events should be logged so let's go back to the events manager okay and here we
12:21:32
go we have everything we got the page views we got initiate checkout view content so everything pretty much worked
12:21:39
here so we can see that the pixel works and now if I go back to the ad that I was creating and I scroll all the way
12:21:46
down to the pixel you can see that the pixel is now active and I can choose it so the steps were quite simple just make
12:21:53
sure that you have all of them the first step was to make sure that we install the Facebook and Instagram app on
12:22:01
Shopify the second is to make sure here in the settings on Shopify under Facebook and Instagram that we have
12:22:07
maximum chosen here and that you have the right pixel selected here if you have multiple pixels you can click on
12:22:13
change and select another pixel most likely in your case you're creating a new pixel so everything will be much
12:22:19
much easier and the flow will be very very smooth and once you have that you're going to open up the Facebook
12:22:24
events manager and make sure that the pixel fires the events and that you can see it under the events manager just
12:22:31
like we did over here once that happens the option here to enable the pixel and it'll be active that's how that will
12:22:38
work okay so you're going to have your Facebook business manager you're going to have your Facebook page which is connected to your Facebook business
12:22:43
manager you're going to create a new pixel install the Facebook and Instagram app and make sure that everything is synchronized together again I know it's
12:22:50
a little bit technical but we want the pixel it's a really really good thing to have okay so everything here is set up
12:22:55
for our first ad copy and for the rest it's going to be easy because we're just going to duplicate this one and just change the creative right here according
12:23:02
to the videos that worked really well for us so we saw that everything is here the description the copy the headline
12:23:09
the button which is shop now the website URL which of course needs to lead to the product page Advantage Plus creative is
12:23:15
toggled off special ad category is toggled off we choose the targeting don't use Advantage audience we chose us
12:23:22
18 to 55 pets cats or dogs as interest so very very broad we're going to have hundreds of millions of customers that
12:23:28
we can reach out to here and we're starting the ad right away it's going to run continuously until we decide to turn
12:23:33
it off I'm putting down $10 for every ad creative per day and under placements make sure that it's only Facebook no
12:23:40
Instagram and messenger and that the pixel is connected so here you can get some estimated results on how this ad
12:23:46
will perform or how many people it will reach and probably how many people are going to do a link click so around 2,800
12:23:53
to 8,000 people per day by spending $10 on this ad copy and they're expecting
12:23:59
around 45 to 130 clicks so let's see if that information is correct so this one
12:24:04
is ready I'm going to go ahead and fire it I'm going to click on publish and I'm going to add my payment settings you
12:24:10
could do this before I'm going to do it right
12:24:18
now okay now it's submitting the ad and the ad is being created so that
12:24:25
is the first ad on Facebook the first out of six now I'm going to do the other five just like we did on Tik Tok but now
12:24:30
I can click on go to ads and see what it actually looks like so this ad is currently under review we're going to
12:24:36
click on view ad all right so now we can see that the ad is in review we can't
12:24:41
really see it and it's not even connected to the ads manager at the moment uh I'll talk about the ads
12:24:48
manager soon well you can see your campaign right now I'm just seeing previous campaigns the these are not the ones that we just created um so we
12:24:54
should see it here soon uh we don't see it there yet it could take a little while it could take a few hours uh and
12:25:00
and when I click here on view ad I'm getting this error something isn't working this maybe because we're
12:25:05
Facebook and we suck we have a lot of technical errors so while we are getting this annoying error there's nothing we
12:25:10
can do we're just going to have to wait it out just like we did with a Tik Tok pixel we have to wait a day for it to work I'm going to wait several hours and
12:25:16
wait for the ad to get reviewed and after it's finished I will be able to review it and I will also be able to see
12:25:23
it inside my ads manager once that happens I'm going to duplicate that ad by five and I'm going to add the rest of
12:25:30
the videos for the two products that we want to sell so some bugs along the way
12:25:35
but we are not going to let that stop us I'll see you soon when the ad finishes the review and I will duplicate for the
12:25:41
rest of the ads and start running ads on both Facebook and Tik Tok Tik Tok is now running well as we all know so the
12:25:48
campaign is working the ad groups are working and the ads under that are working they're all active and Tik Tok
12:25:54
is soon going to start taking my money as we can see right here it's already starting to deliver on some of them so I
12:26:01
only spent like 10 cents here 60 cents here 80 cents here so of course it's nothing yet the impressions are starting
12:26:07
to build up for the first product second product will will start working soon but of course it's way way too early to
12:26:13
start looking at that so when this ad is finished getting reviewed I will be back and I will create the other five ad
12:26:19
copies then Facebook and Tik Tok will both be done so I'll see you soon and we will be able to finish with the Facebook
12:26:25
ads all right so it's day two of running ads on Tik Tok and I woke up to a nice little surprise this morning I got my
12:26:31
first sale from running ads on Tik Tok so I'm actually pretty happy about that and it isn't the product that I expected
12:26:38
to sell right from the start so let me show you exactly what happened and where we stand at the moment so here I am on
12:26:45
my Tik Tok Business Center and you can see right here that so far my ad has been running I got 56 clicks so far I
12:26:52
spent $120 on ad so of course it's not cheap but it's our first ad and you can see here that the product that sold is
12:27:00
the alert Guard Pro so I've got 32 clicks right here which isn't a lot of clicks 3,700 Impressions but it already
12:27:08
made its first sale so I'm going to click here to get more information about this sell and I want you all to check
12:27:15
out the information so this is the video that sold I bought this for my mom who was traveling alone so you guys may
12:27:22
remember that this is the product this is the video that made the most organic
12:27:28
views and you can see here also that the age range is 45 to 54 years old clicked
12:27:34
the most so I think that that's a very important piece of information if we want to narrow this down some more maybe
12:27:39
we could do it on the older audience because I did start off really Broad and I didn't choose any audience interest
12:27:45
for this product so I think it's totally amazing so I got $42 ad spend on this
12:27:50
product and this is the version that I created on cap cut so there was the video that organically did well from Da
12:27:57
Vinci resolve and I decided to run ads on that one and the one that was done on cap cut because that also got some good
12:28:03
organic views and the one that worked on PPC well is the capcut version and this
12:28:08
is the sell right here on Shopify so you can just go over to your orders page on Shopify and of course I cancel the first
12:28:14
three orders because as I mentioned before they're not real I did a fake check out just to make sure that the pixel is working and here you got all
12:28:21
the information about the cell but I'm not going to fulfill the order right here on Shopify I'm going to fulfill it
12:28:27
right here on autods so you can see that this order right now is in pending status and the first three four orders
12:28:34
like I said those are the fake orders so I just cancel them and this is the real order so I can see The Source price is
12:28:41
1318 only AliExpress is going to play a little trick here once I actually sign in and I want you all to see this I'm
12:28:47
going to talk about that when I do it and now what I want to do is simply send the order to automatic order processing
12:28:53
in order to do that you have to go to your plans and add-ons and enable the orders processor right here that costs
12:28:59
$8 a month and it's well worth it because you're going to make that profit back within one order then you want to
12:29:05
go to your supplier settings and choose the supplier that you're fulfilling the order with and you want to enable the
12:29:11
process orders using the fulfilled by autods service and if you toggle on automatic orders then as soon as an
12:29:16
order comes in it's going to get sent out automatically or you can leave it unticked and the order will come in in
12:29:22
pending status and the reason that I do want to send it to automatic orders using fulfilled by autods is because
12:29:28
this service is going to automate the order for me it's going to order the product automatically from the supplier
12:29:34
and fulfilled by autods supports all us-based suppliers that charge a USD currency so we've got several suppliers
12:29:40
we support with this feature not only will the order get processed automatically by the system it won't even use my buyer account to process the
12:29:47
order from the supplier so autods has its own high range of buyer accounts and
12:29:52
the system will use their buyer accounts so again I don't even need to have one I just got to make sure that I'm adding
12:29:58
balance to my account so that the system can use that balance to process the orders using their buyer account and
12:30:04
tracking information will also be updated automatically on autods and on my Shopify store so that the buyer can
12:30:10
always see the status of the order next what I'm also going to do is I'm going to make a sourcing request a sourcing
12:30:16
request will allow me to find a better supplier for this product with either a
12:30:22
lower price faster shipping or even both together and of course the reason that I want that is because I want to find
12:30:29
better agents better suppliers to work with not those suppliers that I'm getting from AliExpress and all of those
12:30:34
other retail marketplaces and that is simply because I want to build and maintain long-term relationship ship
12:30:40
with my suppliers so that we can both Build and Grow our businesses together this way we'll get better products
12:30:46
better pricing faster shipping times happier customers and a more thriving Drop Shipping Store now we can get
12:30:53
sourcing requests for free by the autods system so the only thing that we need to do is go to the orders page and you see
12:31:00
right here next to the order there is a link that says request sourcing it's
12:31:07
right under the sourcing request column so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on that button and that takes me to the sourcing request page right under
12:31:14
the orders page so this is a child page to the parent orders page and here you got the product on the left side and the
12:31:20
next column is the sourcing status so there you can make a new sourcing request simply click on the new button
12:31:28
right on top sourcing request and now the system will find a better source for
12:31:33
this product and it will be linked within the next day or two Max but most
12:31:38
of the time it's going to have within several hours so what we're going to do now is sit back and wait for the system to find us a better supplier and during
12:31:46
this time I hope that my ads will make more sales so that I can come back with more results and show you how I'm going
12:31:52
to process these orders and do everything else so for now let's load up our managed order balance so that I can
12:31:59
have the system pay for these orders since I'm going to be fulfilling it using the fulfilled by autods Method so
12:32:05
every time we're working with autods private suppliers or suppliers that we sourced our products with like I'm doing
12:32:11
now or any one of the other of autod DS's supported suppliers in fulfilled by autods we can use the fulfilled by
12:32:17
autods service so I'm going to choose to load $100 and I'm going to do so with a
12:32:22
payer account you can add a credit card a PayPal account or a payer account they all have their fees whereas pioner is
12:32:29
the lowest at 3% fee so if I load $100 it's going to charge me $103 but I will
12:32:35
have $100 loaded into my balance and then the system can use that balance to pay for my orders now you may have
12:32:41
noticed that I do have a17 balance on my account so I actually
12:32:47
owe autods money so if I load 100 I'm actually going to get 100 minus 17
12:32:52
because my balance is -7 okay so here I'm just going to add my payeer account
12:32:57
add your information now if you don't have pioner that's fine like I mentioned you can add a credit card or payer those
12:33:03
come with 5% fees these may change from time to time so by the time you're watching this video this is what the
12:33:08
fees were at and now I'm simply going to connect to my payer account which is the
12:33:13
next screen that I got after clicking on load $100 it's going to sync with my
12:33:18
paye account and it's going to load in the balance now before I fulfill that order I want to wait for the sourcing
12:33:25
request to come in just to see if I'm going to get a better price and then I'll decide which supplier to fulfill
12:33:31
that order from so I'm going to put that on the side for now I'm going to wait a day to get my sourcing quote and for now
12:33:37
I want to show you some more things on the ads account and although it's only been 2 days usually I like to wait around 3 days
12:33:43
before making any changes to the ads I do have a feeling of what is working well and what isn't what to keep on and
12:33:50
what to turn off so let's jump over and do that right now so as you can see I've got these two ads right here one on
12:33:56
alert Guard Pro and one on Fus Trio and the reason that I'm not showing you the Facebook ads yet is because while I did
12:34:02
launch my first ad and I was waiting to multiply it by five for the rest of the products three for each product I did go
12:34:09
through a small issue with them which I'm working on to resolve at the moment and this is just one of those things
12:34:14
that come up and like I mentioned things will come up we'll have to put up with it we'll have to overcome it and then we
12:34:19
can move forward to the next step if it was so easy everybody would be doing it but I am going to get the solution to
12:34:25
this so here is the issue so I added my payment card as you saw previously in this video and I did get a restriction
12:34:33
from that and I was like restriction why I use this credit card all the time so when I hovered over it this payment
12:34:39
method has been temporarily restricted for security reasons you can request a review from the dot dot dot menu so here
12:34:46
I was looking for a DOT do dot menu and come on guys there is no dot dot dot menu so then I found this button right
12:34:53
here contact support right so I contacted support I was like hey guys
12:34:58
what's why why is my payment method declined right I use this credit card all the time there's no issue with it
12:35:04
and I just got this email from them recently so of course I'm going to have to uh answer back dear customer thank
12:35:10
you for contacting us we appreciate your patience while we gathered your information we noticed unusual activity on your account to assist us in
12:35:17
Expediting our investigation could you please enter the following question so the requested information is a reason
12:35:23
why the country of your payment method does not match your current location hm
12:35:29
that's pretty weird because actually it does only applicable if you use PayPal which I don't so a reason why your
12:35:35
PayPal email address is different than the one associated with your MAA ads account so I'm not using PayPal so that I know that that's not the issue and
12:35:41
Confirmation or proof that you've relocated within the past several years and I did not do any relocation in the
12:35:47
past several years so I know it's not b or c so it's definitely going to have to be something around a I need to figure
12:35:54
out why they see a different country of payment and why it does not match my current location because I'm not using
12:36:00
any vpns with Facebook or anything I'm showing where I'm actually from and so is the credit card so I'm just going to have to appeal this and wait for the
12:36:07
appeal to be over and I've seen a lot of businesses where their Facebook ads account suddenly gets disabled or their
12:36:14
payment method gets declined even though there's no issue with it Facebook is packed with these types of problems
12:36:19
there's an algorithm running all the time and sometimes it does not catch the right things for the right reasons so
12:36:24
I'm just going to appeal to get my payment method approved and during that time I'm going to continue with my
12:36:30
success at Tik Tok ads but again both work really well and I don't want you to only see Tik Tok ads I'm really hoping
12:36:36
that I will get Facebook ads to work for this video so that you can see and have a nice comparison of Facebook versus Tik
12:36:44
Tok and not just being biased on one solution one platform for the same reason why I showed you two different
12:36:50
video editing services and in pretty much everything that I'm showing in this video I'm showing you more than one way
12:36:55
of doing things so that you can compare it with others and really select what is best for you without just making
12:37:01
everything just black and white or you only have one choice for everything and that's the way that you have to go all
12:37:07
right so back to the Tik Tok ads let's turn off the ones that are not performing so well so these are the two
12:37:12
products and right now I'm going over the campaign remember that we've got The Campaign then we've got the ad groups
12:37:18
which are connected to The Campaign which is usually the audience location the placements and all of that so the
12:37:24
campaign is the main goal for your ads the ad group or the ad sets is the placements the audience targeting and
12:37:30
all of that and then there's the ad itself which is the actual copy that you're showing the audiences that you
12:37:37
talked about in your ad Group which is also tied to the main goals that you have in the campaign all right so this
12:37:42
is the campaign you can see how much we've spent so far and the CPM The Impressions I'll talk to you about what
12:37:48
all of that means soon and here you have that one conversion for the alert Guard Pro so now if I go to the ad group you
12:37:54
can see that each one is spending $30 a day to the amount of ads that are inside and here in the ads you can see the six
12:38:01
products and you can see the stats all the information and that one conversion
12:38:06
for the alert Guard Pro now what I like is that that customer I don't know if you've noticed when I showed you the
12:38:12
order on Shopify but the customer ordered two units of this product so that is why we always want to have a
12:38:18
multiple quantity available on our Shopify product pages so don't just have
12:38:23
one that's available he did by two units so that did increase my average order
12:38:29
value meaning we're going to make more profit from this order now so that's a quick skim through of what the ad looks
12:38:35
like and a quick analyzation so we can see right here which ads are kind of
12:38:40
doing well and which ones aren't doing so well and if you look right here and
12:38:46
so what I want to do now is I want to sort by the amount of clicks that I got
12:38:51
I would sort by the amount of conversions which is our overall goal but we only have one conversion so that
12:38:57
there's not much to sort there so the next thing before the conversion is how many clicks I got to my website now
12:39:04
there are other columns that I could add here like how many add two cards I got and how many video views and also
12:39:10
arranged by the amount of add to cards and video views or other types of information like that but I believe in
12:39:17
the the more clicks that you're going to get the more this ad is interesting so this is the ad that has the highest
12:39:22
chance to convert so I will go with the one that got the most clicks now if you have an ad that gets a thousand clicks
12:39:28
and no sales and another ad that got 50 clicks and two sales then of course there's probably a problem with that ad
12:39:35
that got a th000 clicks and no sales go to your product page check it out maybe maybe there's something wrong with the add to card maybe there's something
12:39:41
wrong during the checkout process and hopefully you try to check out just like I showed you by making a 100% promotion
12:39:49
code and checking out with that promo code on your website and that's why I had those three four fake orders because
12:39:55
I also did it on both of the products that I'm selling just to make sure that everything works otherwise that one customer here that bought two versions
12:40:02
of the alert Guard Pro also wouldn't have been able to check out so I'm going to sort this by the amount of clicks and
12:40:08
with that I can see that the number one ad that got the most clicks is the one that got the conversion so you can see
12:40:15
32 clicks right here and that ad made one conversion now you may also notice that this is also the ad that got the
12:40:21
most Impressions Impressions is how many times this ad showed up on someone's screen now if they viewed it that's a
12:40:28
different thing impression does not mean that someone engaged or viewed your content it was just there in front of
12:40:34
their screen and whether they decided to look at it or not that is a different thing so the most Impressions that we
12:40:40
got is for this product so that means that Tik Tok was able to show this product to more people and that is
12:40:47
probably for a couple of reasons one if you guys remember I went totally totally
12:40:52
broad with this product no audience interests this can be suitable for anyone as long as you live with a door
12:41:00
so if you live in a room if you live in an apartment in a conduit in a studio in a hotel room doesn't matter where this
12:41:06
product is relevant to you so as long as you're not six or 10 or 15 years old
12:41:12
this product is relevant to you so I kept it super Broad and in the beginning like I mentioned it's going to be harder for the system harder for the algorithm
12:41:19
to find the Right audience for this product because the algorithm doesn't know it just knows the information that
12:41:24
we give it but it doesn't have any information that it was able to gather on its own so that's why you need to run the ads let the pixel work let the pixel
12:41:32
gather the information and then you can do more things like retargeting similar audiences similar to those who engage
12:41:38
with your product and so so forth but again let's get back to it so this is the product that made the most amount of
12:41:43
Impressions and the most amount of clicks the product that's in second place is the pet hair steam brush which
12:41:50
one the same exact one that got the most video views on the organic videos so the
12:41:57
top two performing ad videos so far on day two of running ads are the same
12:42:02
videos that made it to the top two in the organic videos and that's why it was so important to test the organic videos
12:42:09
now whether the alert Guard Pro is for the The Venture resolve version with no text to speech to cap cut with AI text
12:42:16
to speech there was a difference between the organic short form content to the paid short form content because as you
12:42:23
can see right here number one is with the AI text to speech through cap cut
12:42:29
and number three is the D Vinci resolve but hey guys it's number three that's also not so bad so number three here is
12:42:34
what made number one on the organic results and number one is the same version as number three only with AI
12:42:40
text speech and a different font because that one actually came from cap cut but again both of these videos actually
12:42:46
worked pretty well and I only spent $11 so far on this one but I am going to
12:42:52
consider turning it off and leaving only the top two videos the top video from
12:42:57
the alert Guard Pro and the top video from the firmest Trio pet brush and I'm
12:43:03
going to turn off the rest of the ads just because I can already start to notice a difference over here so we can
12:43:09
see that the pet steam brush is only at nine clicks and by the way if you would
12:43:15
have ran a click campaign Tik Tok or Facebook whichever platform you're running it on would have gotten a lot
12:43:22
more clicks so when you're looking here and you're saying wait you spent $42 or $32 and only nine people or only 30
12:43:28
people clicked on your website for that amount of money because that is not the goal of this campaign if the goal was to
12:43:35
get clicks we would have gotten a lot more clicks but would have we gotten any sales nobody can tell you probably not
12:43:43
maybe and maybe not because that was not the goal of your campaign but if you're
12:43:49
going to work slowly down the funnel and you have a lot of budget for this this is the best way to do it your first
12:43:55
campaign goal should just be to get video views and to get ad engagements on your ad copy then it's going to look for
12:44:01
people the algorithm or it's Tik Tok Facebook whatever are going to look for people that you know they already have
12:44:06
this data on people who just like to engage with posts who they like to click on like and and share and and comment
12:44:13
they probably won't buy the product but this is the stuff that they like to do so it's going to find a whole bunch of people and it's really cheap it's a
12:44:19
really cheap audience for those who will engage with your post then a couple days later you have an ad post with a lot of
12:44:25
engagements a lot of likes a lot of shares lot of comments so now your post looks good it looks like there's a lot
12:44:30
of social proof on it people are excited about this post people are commenting on it and other people who are looking at
12:44:37
it are like oh I said people are enjoying this product maybe I should check it out myself all right so with that you're going to get Social proof
12:44:43
and then the next campaign that you want to run is video views or clicks and that
12:44:48
way the algorithm is going to look for people and it already has a that on these people who like to watch the
12:44:54
bigger part of the video or like 100% of the video or 75% of the video and slash or people who like to click on the ads
12:45:01
and go to websites now again if they are purchasing or not purchasing that is not what the algorithm is looking for so
12:45:06
this is another cheap audience where you can get a lot of clicks to your website and those who click and do click on add
12:45:13
to cart now the algorithms got more information it's like oh okay I was looking for clicks and I got you those
12:45:19
clicks but I also have a few add to cards from those clicks so if you run another campaign looking for add to
12:45:25
cards or looking for checkouts then we can check out the audiences because we
12:45:31
already have some data on it who clicked on add to card on your website so slowly you're fitting the pixel with more and
12:45:37
more data on the audience that are relevant for your product but again this requires a budget and you have to run
12:45:44
several campaigns but this way you're starting off from the top you're starting off really with a cold cold
12:45:50
audience you have no idea who to look out to and slowly slowly the more ads you run the more you understand the more
12:45:57
the pixel the algorithm understands who your target audience is but I am taking
12:46:03
a shortcut I know that you do not have the funds I know that you most likely do do not have thousands of dollars to
12:46:10
spend right from the top to understand who your audience is where to find them and then start scaling it up so I went I
12:46:16
started from the end from the conversion campaign and that's a lot more difficult because the algorithm is like I don't
12:46:23
know who's going to purchase your product because we don't even understand what the type of audience is what your
12:46:28
product is and how we can make one plus one go together so that's why I went
12:46:34
more broad with the alert Guard Pro and I'm so glad that it's sold on day two and it also sold two units and while you
12:46:40
do need somewhat of a budget for it because you are running an ad you are going for a conversion before the Pix to
12:46:46
Le knows who's clicking and who's adding to card on your website it is going to cost more in the beginning but as you
12:46:52
give it more data it's going to start getting cheaper and it's also going to get you better results all right so in hopes of making more sales I am going to
12:46:59
turn off every ad here that is not the first two rows so I'm going to keep the
12:47:05
alert God pro that got 3,700 Impressions 32 clicks and I will keep the Fus Trio
12:47:11
that got 1,700 Impressions and nine clicks and hopefully I will make another
12:47:16
sale by the end of the day or by tomorrow and I will use the rest of my budget on this because I see that these
12:47:22
are the videos that are working so in order to turn off the rest of the ads
12:47:28
right here on the ad screen because I'm turning off specific ads I'm not turning off a whole ad group or a whole campaign
12:47:34
so I'm just going to untick these boxes right here on the left side remember that I'm on the ads tab not the ad group
12:47:42
not the campaign because then I'll be turning off multiple ads without seeing what they are all right so here on the left side I'm going to slowly start to
12:47:49
untick these boxes and keep only the first two ticked in so the ad the budget
12:47:56
the ad spend is going to continue running only for the first two ad videos
12:48:01
that did get me the best results so far and that's it for day two I don't know
12:48:07
what my return of my ads spin is yet I don't know how much I spent how much I profited we're going to get to the bottom of that once we're done with
12:48:13
everything once we understand what's going to happen with Facebook ads as well but I'm more than happy that we got
12:48:18
these results so far because we see that everything is working step by step we found products we created our Shopify
12:48:25
store the right way we added all of the right elements all of the right apps all of the right product page optimizations
12:48:30
with the help of AI and everything else quick product importing quick product research with autods then I ordered the
12:48:37
products to my address I shot video videos on them and I combined my videos with videos of other sellers that did a
12:48:42
great job with these products and I did a mix and match I created great videos with my own special unique Hooks and
12:48:48
then I tested those videos on organic social media and with that YouTube got me some really nice results to help me
12:48:54
understand what videos are performing well and I took those videos as well as the others and I put them all into
12:49:00
pay-per-click marketing to test them all out only in the PPC I only took the top three videos that worked well on organic
12:49:07
whereas an organ organic I did five videos for each product so out of 10 products that we tested organically we
12:49:13
only kept six of them for paperclick ads and now we turned off four of them and kept the top two performers to hopefully
12:49:20
make more sales on them because we already have the data on what the audiences like more when it comes to our
12:49:25
pay-per-click ads so that is it for the first couple of days of running ads and let's see what's going to happen soon
12:49:32
all right day three of running paid ads is over and I did manage to get another sale and this time it's for the firm
12:49:38
Trio product so I was able to sell both products running paid ads and now let me break down the information show you
12:49:44
what's sold go to the sourcing request see if we got a better product and fulfill our ORD so I'm going to do some
12:49:50
ad analyzation then we're going to move over to automatic order fulfillment all right so here we go these are the two
12:49:57
ads that I kept running now if you remember I turned off these because they weren't performing as well as these two
12:50:03
and I kept running these two as you can see right now the status is not delivering because my bud budget my my
12:50:09
initial budget did run out all right so here are the two ads that performed the
12:50:15
best and I am glad that I kept this second ad running for ferus Trio even
12:50:20
though it wasn't looking that good where I only had about eight or nine clicks
12:50:26
now I was able to almost double that within a day but again clicks is not what we're looking for this is what
12:50:31
we're looking for right here the conversions so I was able to make a sale here as well now I'm going to break down
12:50:37
the info soon but let's also check it out on Shopify so I did get my first order here and this is from a customer
12:50:45
called Mark and Mark did order two units of the alert Guard Pro so this was the
12:50:51
first ad sell that we were able to get and I've got all his information right here we just need to process the order I
12:50:57
do have the sourcing request information so we're going to take a look at that and process the order with the cheapest
12:51:03
way and the fastest shipping available and the second order is right here from Francis now Francis did buy the F Miss
12:51:10
Trio product and she did go with the brown paw variant so we're going to
12:51:15
check that out also soon but again we're not going to be fulfilling these orders on Shopify we will be fulfilling these
12:51:22
orders on autods and as you can see all the info is exactly the same just easier
12:51:27
to see on autods easier to manage an autods and anyway we'll be fulfilling our orders right here through autods so
12:51:34
again don't worry about these canceled orders these are fake orders that we added it's the same as these orders
12:51:39
right here when I was doing testing to make sure that we can check out what the products these are the two orders that
12:51:44
we got these are the item total so $76 for the first order $15 for this so we
12:51:50
got about $115 in sales on the second product and this is what we're seeing
12:51:55
right here okay so before I move on to order fulfillment let's just analyze the ads a little bit more so while I did
12:52:02
turn off the last four kept these first two running and the next day I did get the sale for the second product The Firm
12:52:09
Miss Trio now we can see the total ad spend right here which of course is relatively high and I was ready for it
12:52:14
and that is simply because I jumped straight to the conversion campaign I wanted to make a sale as soon as
12:52:20
possible whether it's profitable or not I just want to make my sales I want to gather some data gather some information
12:52:26
and then use that data to further scale and optimize my sales my profits my return on ad spend so while you can see
12:52:33
that the cost here is relatively High I've got $79 in ad spend on the first product where I was able to get an order
12:52:41
totaling $76 and we do need to subtract the product cost from that $76 to
12:52:46
understand exactly how much we profited so while we will not be breaking even or profiting here again it is only the
12:52:52
beginning of the journey and many people are not able to make sales at all in the
12:52:57
beginning Even after spending hundreds and even thousands of dollars on ads and I do not want that to happen to you too
12:53:04
that is why I want to teach you step by step what to do how to do it right and even once you do make sales how to
12:53:11
further optimize that so that you can be in the profit Zone it's probably not going to come from running your first ad
12:53:17
but if you know exactly when to turn it off which ads to put more money on and how to save even more money by working
12:53:24
on what work for you organically that is all going to play out in your favor so right now we can see a total cost of $79
12:53:32
for the first ad and $76 for the second one for the ferus Trio then we've got
12:53:37
the CPC or cost per click so this is how much we paid to for every time someone
12:53:42
clicked on our website but again this was not the campaign's goal and if it was the campaign's goal and we had to
12:53:48
pay $1 or close to $5 for every click that would be a very very bad ad that
12:53:54
you need to turn off right away and before I move into the rest of the columns I do want to add more columns
12:54:01
just to make it easier to understand what happened here so now what we're doing is we're analyzing the ads to
12:54:07
learn what worked for us why it worked and then we can do a better job on the next one that we run then I'm going to
12:54:13
go ahead and process the orders and show you how to do that as well because those customers are waiting all right so here
12:54:20
are all of the columns that we can add to that ad so again I just clicked right here on default columns and then I
12:54:26
clicked on customize columns okay and these are all the things that we can add and view but we definitely do not need
12:54:32
all of them we don't want to confuse it we only want to look at what is important okay so first we've already
12:54:37
got cost net cost is is not important and you can see CPC right here so we talked about that as cost per click CPM
12:54:43
is the average that you will spend over 1,000 Impressions so how much would you pay per 1,000 Impressions and then
12:54:50
you've got the Impressions remember that that is how many times your ad showed on a customer screen or on a viewer screen
12:54:57
doesn't mean that they watch it doesn't mean that they engage with it that is different this is just how many times it showed up on someone's screen then
12:55:03
you've got how many times someone clicked CTR is Click through rating so that's a percentage of Impressions that
12:55:09
resulted in a destination click out of all of your impressions then you've got the reach so this is the number of
12:55:16
people who saw the ad at least once and they saw the ad it's not just an
12:55:21
impression they actually looked at the ad for at least one or two seconds so I will put that on I want to see how many
12:55:27
people saw the ad cost per 1,000 people who reach doesn't really matter cuz that is not our goal I will add frequency
12:55:33
because this helps you understand if the ad was kind of like showing itself too
12:55:38
many times to the same person and if that happens well you do not want that to happen so if your frequency is
12:55:44
anywhere over 1.3 1.5 that means that it's showing more than the average of
12:55:50
once per viewer and that is not always the best thing especially when we're running these types of ads it's an
12:55:56
impulse purchase either you're going to do it or you're not going to do it but if I show it to you again that same day
12:56:01
or the next day it's probably not going to work if it didn't work the first time so this is not something that you want
12:56:07
to have you want to make sure that your frequency is low anywhere around the 1.0 Zone okay and then you've got
12:56:13
conversions which is how many times you were able to reach your goal for this campaign for this ad so if our goal was
12:56:21
to initiate checkout and to complete the payment then that is the conversion if
12:56:26
it was to get video views then that would be the conversion okay then you've got cost per conversion so how many
12:56:32
times I have to pay to get that conversion then you've got the conversion rate realtime conversions we can leave all that off results is is
12:56:38
always great to have because you want to see the results cost per result and the result rate which is the percentage of
12:56:43
results that happened out of all the Impressions we can leave that on the next thing that I want to have here is the video views now while I do
12:56:51
understand what ads worked and most likely they're the ones that got the most video views and we can also get
12:56:57
this information from the organic marketing that we ran we already have the data here so might as well cross check it and see what videos work the
12:57:04
best okay so I'm going to leave only two on here video View is at 100% so I want to see how many times someone watched
12:57:11
100% of the whole ad because if I can see that for example the video views
12:57:16
usually stop at 75% that's why I also have that one on so I want to see 75% and 100% anything below that is not good
12:57:23
so if a lot of people watch 75% of the video but not many stayed from 75 to 100% then I know that in the last part
12:57:30
of the video I could probably make it a little bit better so this is what I want to understand here as well where we can
12:57:36
further optimize and tweak and find tune our videos then we've got the total engagement okay so this is also a nice
12:57:43
thing to have clicks all is about the same that we're going to see in Click so it's not really going to make much of a
12:57:48
difference same thing for CTR we already have that um all of that likes comments shares we don't really need any of that
12:57:55
so anything else here we don't really need we can leave that off product product clicks destination is the same
12:58:01
as the first clicks that we have so everything else here is not really relevant for us but I do want to see add
12:58:09
to cards all right so let's see how many times we got add to cards and how many times we got a checkout because checkout
12:58:15
doesn't mean that he finished putting in his payment info then we've also got add payment info and I think that that
12:58:23
should be it let me just make sure yes everything else here is not relevant for
12:58:28
this campaign okay so we're good I'm going to go ahead and click on confirm now okay so we're pretty good here the
12:58:34
last thing that you can do is also arrange the columns in the order that you want to see them so for example let's see what we just
12:58:41
added all right so for example let's say we want to see the add to cards and the
12:58:47
video views uh we're going to see it after the frequency and all of that okay we can leave it there but in any case if
12:58:53
you wanted to uh change something like let's say wait cost per payment info we
12:58:59
don't really need that payment info ad is fine checkout value value per checkout we don't need those okay how
12:59:06
many how much the checkout cost how much the payment info cost we don't really need those we just need a total value
12:59:12
okay so no cost per add to card value add to card add to card value so just add to card and check out okay I'm just
12:59:19
going to turn off the rest of these that we uh added here and anyway if you want to see it sooner then let's say video
12:59:24
views okay I'm going to put that much higher up so let's put that after Impressions okay so I see how many times
12:59:30
my ad showed in front of someone's screen before how many times he clicked it I want to check out the video views
12:59:35
at 75% and 100% so now we're going to click on confirm and by the way running Tik Tok ads and running Facebook ads is
12:59:42
very very similar so the same things that you can see here like the custom columns and the types of values or the
12:59:48
types of attributes that you can see is very very identical to both platforms all right so now let's scroll to the
12:59:55
right and after Impressions we should start seeing right here the video views at 75% and the video views at 100% so we
13:00:02
can see here that the first two ads right so the first one of course is the alert Guard Pro the second one is the
13:00:08
firm is Trio so the first one ended off with 5,750 Impressions and the second
13:00:13
product is 3 3,250 and but look at the difference in the video views so of course a lot more
13:00:20
people viewed it and we can see here that the first product the alert Guard Pro got 590 video views at 75% and 299
13:00:29
at 100% but I do also need to compare that to the amount of Total video views that we got just to see what is the
13:00:34
difference what is the Delta between them so let's go back to customize columns I left that one out click on custom columns again and just scroll a
13:00:41
bit down you've got this total all video views right here so let's just activate
13:00:46
that as well and confirm oh wait we also need to
13:00:52
put it in the right spot so let's take video views and drag it up to after
13:00:59
100% all right now let's take a look so we've got 75% out of
13:01:05
5,329 video views which is a lot so out of 5,750 Impressions about 400
13:01:13
people didn't stick to watch the first few seconds of the video but the rest did that's actually a lot of people and
13:01:19
same thing for the fmus trio 3,251 people saw this on their screen and
13:01:24
3,143 went on to watch the video but they didn't watch a lot of it and you can see it right here so for the first
13:01:30
product 590 watch it until 75% only 299 watch it all the way to the end but one
13:01:37
of those people ended up purchasing the product and for the second one we can
13:01:42
see that video views at 75% is at 93 59 out 100% out of a total of
13:01:50
3,143 so not a lot of people stuck around to watch the whole video but we do have a nice bunch of people that did
13:01:55
watch the video to the end and of course a couple which actually ended up buying the product which is the most important
13:02:00
thing here and it does look like the video starts to die down towards the end because if 590 people watch at 7 75% and
13:02:09
only 300 ended up watching 100% that means that 291 people here between 75% and 100%
13:02:18
turned off the video so that does mean that we can make the ending of the videos a little bit better but on the
13:02:25
other hand don't forget that most people it's just like watching videos on YouTube and everywhere else the longer
13:02:30
the video continues the less audience retention you have so this is always a
13:02:35
natural figure just make sure that it's not too big between the 75% to the 100%
13:02:42
so this is another nice little figure to have but at the end of the day it's how many conversions we made how many sales
13:02:48
we made so again we can see the results right here and if we click right here on view data we can get more information
13:02:55
about the audiences that purchased this product so if we decide to rerun this ad or duplicate and try something else we
13:03:02
can do it with better data and this is how the ads are going to get better and better the we run them will I continue
13:03:09
running them will I continue to optimize them after doing this maybe we'll see I still have a lot more to do here but
13:03:16
this is something important I do want you guys to get the marketing part right because once you do everything else really becomes simple all right so for
13:03:23
this product again we' got our one purchase uh our cost per result so how much it costs us to get that one uh goal
13:03:30
that one purchase that one conversion the total number of Impressions total number of clicks cost per click which
13:03:37
went down a lot from the first day so if you remember after I showed you uh day one and a half or day two the cost per
13:03:43
click was a lot higher I don't remember exactly what it was at but it was more than a dollar and now it's $116 again
13:03:50
that's pretty expensive for a cost per click and it should usually get better as you run more ads but again our goal
13:03:57
here was not clicks and if it was clicks we would have been here in the something sense Zone okay click- through rating
13:04:03
1.2% that is not a very good click- through rating but again we're not going through clicks and if it was less than
13:04:09
1% it would have been pretty horrible okay so let's get better data so we can see right here the dates that the ad Ran
13:04:16
So for the first day it used about $19 of our budget and we didn't get any purchases second day $23 of our budget
13:04:24
and we did get one purchase so if it was only this day we would have been in the profit Zone but of course we ran the ad
13:04:30
for more days so Third Day $30 no purchases and fourth day $7 what was
13:04:35
left of the budget before the balance ran out and again uh zero purchases you can see how many clicks on each day and
13:04:42
I think the amazing thing here is that it actually kept getting better cuz you can see here on the day that we made the
13:04:49
sell which is this day right here right you can see that the sell came in here so on this day the reach was around
13:04:56
1,500 same thing as the next day where there was no sales and there wasn't as many clicks either you can see that this
13:05:01
day where there was only eight clicks and out of eight clicks one person purchased the next day there were 28
13:05:07
clicks without any purchases which is completely fine but you can see that the clicks are getting better and better and
13:05:14
of course it turned off on the third day because the budget just simply ran out if I would have given this ad more time
13:05:20
if I would optimize the ad right now with the info that I have and continue to run it with better audience targeting
13:05:28
I can already see where this is going the fact that I was able to get a purchase on the first two products two
13:05:34
out of two products were able to sell now of course if I were to spend thousands of dollars on ads and and lost
13:05:40
thousands of dollars and hey guys I sold the product then it's like okay but you lost thousands of dollars now here while
13:05:47
we're still not in the profit Zone and I do believe that I can get there with these two products because usually on
13:05:52
your first few attempts you're not going to find your winners and this is just a natural thing until we start to learn
13:05:59
slowly what products are good what makes them winning products and you can already see that these are winning
13:06:04
products we just need to get better with the algorithm we need to get better with the data and usually does not come right
13:06:10
away not after one two days of running ads okay we need to continue optimizing and making it better so let's see what
13:06:17
other data we can get here to make our ads better and be in the big big profit zone so we already saw how many clicks
13:06:24
how many views the conversions and all of that but if we click right here on audience then we can get audience data
13:06:31
and this is where we can get better with the algorithm and with the Tik Tok pixel so for the product that sold for the ad
13:06:38
that's sold you can see right here that the major audience about almost 50% of
13:06:44
the people who viewed the ad are in the age range of 45 to 54 and if you guys
13:06:50
remember correctly I was thinking if we should add this age range and also go
13:06:55
all the way up to 65 and by looking at the stats here we can see that the younger they are the less they cared
13:07:02
about this product so 18 to 24 6% of the views we only spend $4 on them because
13:07:09
the algorithm saw that this is not the type of audience that will click and purchase the product then 25 to 34 takes
13:07:15
about 15% of the people who viewed the ad then we've got 30% around the age
13:07:22
range of 35 to 54 and the rest 45 to 54 so if I were to rerun this ad I would
13:07:29
make it around the age around the end of this one so I would say around from 30
13:07:35
all the way up to even 6 5 and that would be who I would Market this product
13:07:41
to maybe the young people don't really care about security that much you know when you're young you kind of feel
13:07:46
Invincible I don't need that much security I'm kind of good on my own and the older you get the more you
13:07:52
understand the way that the world works and the good versus the bad people that are actually out there and you're a
13:07:58
little bit more matured and with that you do invest a little bit more into your own personal security so that makes
13:08:05
sense for this product and if I were to put another budget here and rerun the ads I would definitely definitely take
13:08:11
that into consideration I think that this is one of the biggest takeaways from running this specific ad for this
13:08:17
product next let's check out location so we can see that the United States of course because that is the country that
13:08:23
I was targeting that is what took all of the ad spend for this ad so we can see that most of them are coming from
13:08:29
California unknown because they've got their IP block Texas New York Florida okay that's all great and the total
13:08:36
stats from the age ranges that we were looking at so 45 to 54 cost us more than
13:08:42
the other age ranges but that is the one that also gave us a sell at the end but if we try to see who gave us a sell in
13:08:49
the end sadly here it's unknown that person was blocking their information
13:08:54
from being seen and that is the least amount of people look 24 Impressions and
13:09:00
only 24 Impressions from unknown because people usually just do not really mask their identities only this one did
13:09:06
purchase and that is completely fine with me because I already have the stats over here you can hide hide all you want
13:09:13
but I know that most of my purchasers most of my video viewers most of my ad
13:09:19
engagers are around the age of 45 to 54 so this is probably where my customer
13:09:24
realize and this is where I would retarget my ads a combination of this of this and a little bit of this all right
13:09:31
let's move over to gender so 2.25% is unknown probably Generation Z
13:09:39
and here we've got male and female so male 45 female 32 so that is pretty
13:09:46
tight pretty close m mostly are male but I would not distinguish between male and female here 40% to 56% I would
13:09:53
definitely run this ads to both male and female and if we add both age and gender together we can once again see here that
13:10:00
45 to 54 again is the winner most being male then female most male then female
13:10:05
for 35 to 54 25 to 34 so it's almost even almost the same I would not
13:10:12
differentiate between them when I am running my ads okay so the one takeaway
13:10:17
from the alarm door stopper is that this should be marketed to the older audience
13:10:23
for the reasons that I mentioned now let's check out the second one so the second product that sold this is the ad
13:10:29
right here and let's check out the information so the ad spend here was about $76 that gave us that one
13:10:35
conversion so the cost for that version was $76 again not in the super profit Zone at least not here not at the
13:10:41
beginning but making sales once again as opposed to not making sales and not
13:10:47
putting that much of a budget on it already shows you that you're in the right direction now do your fine-tuning
13:10:52
and put yourself in the profit zone so how do we do that here let's check out the audience that engage with this and
13:10:59
wow this is pretty amazing it looks almost like the previous graph that we were looking at for the alarm door
13:11:05
stopper so we can see firm is Trio right here taking up again 45 to 54 is 48% of
13:11:11
the people that engage with this ad that is absolutely amazing it's a pet product it's on Tik Tok where I didn't expect so
13:11:18
many people around that age range on Tik Tok but not only are they here they're also clicking and purchasing that is
13:11:24
absolutely amazing then we've got 35 to 54 which makes up for 25% and 25 to 34
13:11:32
which makes up another 20% so here again the majority goes to the old people to
13:11:38
to the age range of 45 to 54 and the smallest amount goes to 18 to 24 which
13:11:43
is just 6% so we can definitely put that on the side not important this is not where we're going to make ourselves but
13:11:50
it's most likely going to come from these age ranges okay so keeping that in mind let's also check out age and gender
13:11:56
and here you can see it's a lot more balanced even females I think maybe even have more let's check out only gender
13:12:02
first wow so females actually overdid the males here so 38% to females so $38
13:12:07
spend on females which makes up for 50% and the other 47% 36 add spend on males
13:12:14
and the rest is unknown about 2% so again this is pretty even stevenh I would definitely put this on both males
13:12:19
and females I would not differentiate between them in the ads but here it's a lot a lot closer and here if I click
13:12:25
again on age and gender you can just see how close they are and in some aspects 25 to 34 and 18 to 24 so 18 to 34 there
13:12:34
is more females even from 35 to 44 the the only time there was a little bit more male than female was around the age
13:12:40
range of 45 to 54 but again super super small differences let's see which age
13:12:45
range is the ones that purchased the pet steam product the firmus trio so the
13:12:51
conversions here again came from unknown wow so either Tik Tok doesn't want to
13:12:57
feed us this information or the very small out of 10 Impressions that we got unknown those are the ones that
13:13:03
purchased I'm not sure what's up with the algorithm maybe it doesn't want to share the info doesn't really make sense
13:13:09
that out of 10 Impressions that is the one that would convert so I'm not sure which age range it actually came from
13:13:15
but again just go with the data it doesn't really matter because you have all of this and just like you saw with
13:13:21
my ads it it is a numbers game the ad that's making the most amount of clicks the most amount of views is most likely
13:13:28
the one that is going to get the purchases now this is not going to be exact for every ad that you run but this
13:13:35
is where most of the chances are going that's why if you remember correctly I turned off all the ads after the top two
13:13:41
that were performing best even though the second one didn't make any sales yet and the next day it made that sell and
13:13:48
the number one ad for the alarm door stopper that made a sell on day two and
13:13:53
the customer paid $75 by ordering two units that is the ad that got the most
13:13:58
Impressions the most clicks and the most views so it's also the same over here so if you're going to Target according to
13:14:04
the numbers game where you got the most amount of data given to you saying hey
13:14:09
this is the age range of people who are viewing your product that is the age range that you also want to Target when
13:14:14
running the next ad all right now you can do the same test the same statistics lookout for not just the final ad
13:14:22
creative which right now we were just looking at this winning creative and that winning creative which I think is giving you the most relevant information
13:14:29
but you can go a little bit more abroad than that and see how the whole ad group worked out for you or even better how
13:14:35
the whole campaign worked out for you so if for example I click now on the campaign column and now I hover over
13:14:42
alert Guard Pro and click on view data it's going to show the data for the whole campaign for the ad group that's
13:14:47
in it and all of the three ad creatives that are connected to it so here we can see a total ads SP of $97 because again
13:14:55
it takes up all of the ads that we ran here with the detailed analysis here at the bottom but that is not what we're
13:15:00
here to look at what we actually want to see is right here the audience okay so
13:15:06
here again it's looking pretty much the same so 45 to 54 is the winner then 35 to 44 and 25 to 34 this shows you the
13:15:14
whole campaign under alert Guard Pro and you can do the same thing for ferus Trio now because I turned off the rest of the
13:15:21
ads and only kept the best one running the information is going to be around the same but this was before we turned
13:15:27
off the ads so you can check out the statistics for the whole campaign and
13:15:32
one more thing that you have on top of that when you're doing the campaign analysis on Tik Tok ads you've got the
13:15:37
search column right here and this will give you the search term that people
13:15:43
search for in order to find your product so I think that this is very
13:15:48
informational and just check out the information that we have here so when someone was searching for Dodge Ram
13:15:54
T-Rex rex on live stream that gave 198 impressions for this product I'm not
13:16:00
sure exactly why maybe because it has to do with security you just wreck your
13:16:06
Dodge Ram on a live stream I'm not exactly sure why Tira Walker State of
13:16:12
Emergency at Disney World so this is probably because of the uh word emergency also same thing for the next
13:16:18
one emergency alert system warning this one is relevant this one should have
13:16:24
showed to a lot of Impressions where here it only got 63 Impressions that is not a lot the one that made the most
13:16:30
Impressions is the Dodge Ram T-Rex rex on live stream I'm not sure why people were searching for that and then they
13:16:36
saw my had and two of them clicked on it out of 198 Impressions and let's see
13:16:42
where the conversion came from not from any of these so we're not going to have that much to learn from this one let's
13:16:48
move on to the next page so there's a lot of Search terms here but I cannot see if the conversion came from any one
13:16:53
of them let's try to uh sort by conversion okay so it didn't come from any of the Search terms but I do want
13:16:59
you to have this piece of information in your pocket as well let me again sort it by The Impressions because this will
13:17:06
help you understand why people people are searching for in order to get to your ad so next time you run the ad
13:17:11
maybe you could add some of these keywords inside your ad copy in the title or in the description somewhere there because Tik Tok decided to show
13:17:18
this to those people who are searching for these things so check it out one person wrote emergency alert system
13:17:24
warning 63 Impressions two clicks someone searched for door stoer alarm safety they were probably even searching
13:17:30
for this product or something similar to it 47 Impressions but no clicks husband caught on camera I don't know why that
13:17:37
one got two clicks I don't know what that one was looking for creature CAU on camera Texas I'm kind of offended
13:17:44
because I think that they're looking at the video where I was like pretending to rob the place so I was like catching
13:17:50
myself on camera so they're calling me a creature okay door lock security and Bayside Mall security cameras so these
13:17:56
are some search results that people search for on Tik Tok and before Tik Tok showed them the results of the video
13:18:01
first it played our ad because it felt like our ad was related to it and if people actually click on it then they'll
13:18:08
show it to more people who are searching for something similar to that because they realize that this ad is resonating with people who are searching for a
13:18:13
certain thing okay so nice to see it there let's also check out the search for fmus trio so again this can only be
13:18:19
done when you're analyzing from the campaign and then you're going to click on search and let's see what we've got
13:18:25
here let's see if the conversions came from any search I'm going to just do this first okay it didn't come from a
13:18:31
search here as well but again we are going to use this information to see where our ads are being shown when
13:18:37
people are searching for what so catcom okay great thank you Tik Tok for understanding what this product is
13:18:44
because every time someone searched for catcom you showed it to 45 people and one of them even clicked okay so that's
13:18:51
cool uh and everywhere else we didn't really get any clicks so it's not really relevant but it showed on small round
13:18:57
hole on nail clipper the product has nothing to do with that cats getting scared my cats weren't scared they were
13:19:03
happy funny cats videos it was kind of funny funny animals video okay I see what you did there cat videos cat videos
13:19:09
cat videos meow meow meow so everything that has to do with cats this was actually a lot more relevant but I do
13:19:16
think that one of the things that I should have done better for the firm Miss Trio is to not try to narrow it
13:19:24
down so much to people who love pets pet owners vets and everything that has to
13:19:31
do around dogs cats and pets it kind of did narrow down my audience a lot where
13:19:36
as on the alert Guard Pro I went super super broad no audience interest targeting but there's a reason for that
13:19:43
because the alert Guard Pro can fit so many people only now I realize that it's much more for the more mature audiences
13:19:50
the older audiences that is a great Insight that I just learned but as for ferus Trio I think that we should have
13:19:56
tried a more broad approach and even though I do like the fact that it only showed it to people who are searching
13:20:02
for things around cats the sale did not come from there and I think that we just need to do a more broad targeting maybe
13:20:09
only targeting on cats and dogs without the whole pet owners and every other interest that we added there but I
13:20:15
always like to try a more Niche downarrow approach as opposed to a broad approach and in this case broad did work
13:20:21
better so that is analyzing the ads that is how you understand what ad worked
13:20:26
better what you could have done to also make it better and again at the end of the day I'm super happy that both of the
13:20:33
products sold because it does show that we're in the right direction so how could we do it better alert Guard Pro
13:20:40
once again better audience age targeting for the older audiences whether male or
13:20:46
female I don't care as long as you're around the age ranges of 30 all the way up to 65 and for the ferus Trio the pet
13:20:54
steamer product I will try a less narrow down approach still being around the
13:20:59
broad area but maybe having interest around just cats and dogs in general okay so very very general so it's still
13:21:07
very broad just a very bit narrowed down but still very very Broad and age range also a little bit older people around 18
13:21:14
to 24 are not really buying this product are not really viewing the ad are not really clicking on it but around 30 all
13:21:20
the way up to 55 maybe 60 65 all of that is relevant especially in the older zone
13:21:26
so I would definitely change the ages of the people that I'm showing this ad to and I would just keep the ad running
13:21:33
some more on the video copy that worked the best because now we already have some info we already have data on people
13:21:40
who are viewing people who are clicking and most importantly people who are purchasing and this is the money time
13:21:48
now that I actually have some data even though it's only one person from this product and one person from that product
13:21:53
now that I have some data the Tik Tock pixel is a lot smarter now and if I continue running these ads for a longer
13:22:00
time and just tweaking the audience age range a bit I am sure that I'm going to make more sales and be in the high
13:22:07
profit Zone and while I do like both products I do have more faith in the alert Guard Pro because of the higher
13:22:14
price tag because of the higher flexibility the higher reach that you have to a more relevant audience because
13:22:21
it's not just for people who like pets which is again narrowed down and super competitive now I think both products
13:22:26
can be profitable but I think that we can make it to the profit Zone first with the alert Guard Pro in any case we
13:22:31
already have data that we can use and rerun the ads put our budgets back ins side and watch how we are getting more
13:22:38
clicks more sales in less time and less of a budget because the pixel is getting smarter and smarter and I did not expect
13:22:45
to make a sale in my first couple of days better yet two sales from the first batch of ads from the first couple of
13:22:52
products without testing out a whole bunch more and more before we start seeing results so again it already shows
13:22:57
us that we're on the right direction now it's up to us to tweak and tune our ads make them more precise with the data
13:23:03
that we have put our budgets back inside and again again I do recommend to start with the minimum ad spend that you can
13:23:10
put in just so that you can see the data after a couple days understand what ads are working well what to turn off and
13:23:16
after you start making sales you can start to put a little bit of more money into those winning ad copies and of
13:23:22
course it is not over once you found your winning ad copies you can always create more videos continue posting
13:23:28
organic content and seeing what works you're also going to make sales from organic content believe me when you have
13:23:34
enough organic content out there that is is also going to give you sales and profit but you're going to use that as a
13:23:39
machine to help you test out what to put your budget on because it doesn't cost money to post more organic content you
13:23:45
can post 100 organic videos today and that's not going to cost you anything and you will see results you will be
13:23:51
able to use that data and leverage it to your advantage when you're actually putting down a budget and running paid
13:23:56
marketing so this whole system works together and once you get the hang of it once you dive inside it's easy to take
13:24:02
the results and turn that into better and bigger success especially if you're able to sell the
13:24:08
first two products that you are running ads on without spending thousands of dollars and putting a big hole in your
13:24:13
pocket so now that we have a great idea of how ads work how to run them how to
13:24:18
optimize them how to analyze them and how to make them better as we continue running more spending more money but
13:24:24
getting better results and again the more we run the more data we get the better our ads are going to run and then
13:24:31
you can use all this data because remember that the pixel is gathering data and you can tell the pixel hey hey
13:24:36
I'm running ads on a new product now but it's very much related to the previous product that I ran so you can save this
13:24:42
custom audience that I built for the uh pet product for the fmus trio or for the alert guard stopper you can build custom
13:24:49
audiences for each one so next time you run an ad on a similar product you can say hey I want the audience that you
13:24:55
want to look for here you don't have to start from scratch I already have some data here's the custom audience that I saved from the previous ad on a similar
13:25:02
product so start with that info start with that data that you already have so again the more ads that you run the
13:25:08
better results you're going to get so don't put all of your money on the first ads that you run leave some more space
13:25:14
for optimization leave some more for running more ads to continue the success that you have with the data that you
13:25:20
were able to get from the first ones see your first ads as an investment for the data you're buying data that nobody can
13:25:28
get for free on the market and then you're going to use that data to further optimize your ads and that is when
13:25:34
you're going to break the break even and be in the area of profit where this business starts to get really fun and
13:25:41
addicting okay so enough about ads for now let's go to order processing and
13:25:46
understand how to process these orders automatically by the system so that we won't have to go to our suppliers
13:25:52
websites and purchase the products and ship it to our customers addresses and hope that everything kind of works out along the way all right so now let's
13:25:59
process the two orders that I got by running Tik Tok ads and as you already
13:26:04
saw it's here on my order screen on autods now after I got the first sale on Tik Tok ads for alert Guard Pro before I
13:26:11
turned off the you know all the other AD sets and everything else I did make a sourcing request so that we can get a
13:26:16
better price let the system find a better supplier so here are the results of that sourcing request so we can see
13:26:22
it right here on alert Guard Pro so we can see that the sourcing status is ready so we do have information we do
13:26:29
have a better supplier so we're going to check that out soon and we can see here also the firm is Trio which I did not
13:26:35
make a sourcing request for I could do just by clicking on this button but we're not doing that now cuz we already did it for this one so I'm going to
13:26:41
process both of these orders each one using its own method and you can see how both methods work okay so here we've got
13:26:47
some information what is the total source price that we got we can see a price range that's because we've got different variations in that Source
13:26:53
price the shipping time so the best shipping time we we found here was 6 days which is great and of course the store is prime jungle so I can view the
13:27:00
products view the orders we don't need to do that now let's click on sourcing details and understand exactly what we
13:27:05
get got here so here is the sourcing details this one is ready we can see right here and this is what we were able
13:27:12
to find so item cost $462 that sounds really good but we do have to take into consideration that it does not include
13:27:19
shipping so shipping price is $11 and also on top of that we can see that this is the variation that comes without the
13:27:26
door alarm it doesn't have that black thing here in the middle so I'm going to click here on the variations and see
13:27:32
what variations we got here so we've got different variations right here and what I'm looking looking for is the one with the alarm so it's probably the next one
13:27:39
and yes it is that next one right here so this one cost $6 and the shipping price is $11 now we do have to check out
13:27:45
the shipping to make sure that we're choosing the best shipping option for our buyers so here I'm going to click on shipping and I do have a shipping that
13:27:53
is 30 cents cheaper but it's going to make the shipping time increase by about a week and I do not want that so I will
13:28:00
keep this one right here that cost $11 the carrier is called un Express that's from China
13:28:06
and we can see that the shipping time is 8 days which is absolutely perfect from a product coming from China shipping to
13:28:12
the US so I am going to keep this one right here and I'm going to click here on save for all variations and that's it
13:28:20
so this one is going to cost $11 plus $462 so that's
13:28:25
$15.62 and if I compare that to the original product so in order to do that just go to the orders page and look at
13:28:32
the product right here on the right side you've got the buy idid so I'm just going to click on the buy ID because
13:28:37
this is where we're currently buying the product from if we're not going with the sourcing method so right now we're buying it from AliExpress for
13:28:44
$921 and you did see a cheaper price and that was because we were not signed in
13:28:49
every time you sign into AliExpress you will notice that the price is different than what it showed you before you
13:28:54
signed in because if you're not signed in alexpress thinks that you're a new user and it wants to surprise new users
13:29:00
with like hey what's up new user check out this amazing price for this product go ahead and register your account and
13:29:05
purchase it then you're going to register your account probably get some crappy coupon that's not going to be worth anything but the prices will
13:29:12
change after you sign in so in this case it did change to 1921 which is kind of expensive and we already got a better
13:29:19
Source price here so instead of 1921 we are going to spend $562 so that's
13:29:25
already $4 cheaper and we are going to get it shipped within 8 days so it's
13:29:30
going to deliver within a week a week and a half whereas here it's going to take around two weeks so faster shipping
13:29:37
cheaper price through autod DS's free sourcing feature so I want to go with this source so what I can do here is a
13:29:44
few things one you can message about the sourcing request so you can send a message to the supplier ask a few
13:29:50
questions if you have any or you can request a change if you didn't like something about the source the price is
13:29:56
too high the shipping methods aren't good enough it's not the same exact variation that you wanted it's not the color that you wanted or whatever you
13:30:03
can click here to request a change right whatever ches you want to see and it will request a new source and take into
13:30:09
consideration the changes that you want okay but in our case it's perfectly fine we are going for this variation with the
13:30:17
alarm and this is the one that we want so sorry it's not $15 it's $17 it's $6
13:30:23
plus $11 for shipping cuz this is the variation with the alarm so $17 not 1921
13:30:31
save that extra couple of bucks get faster shipping we're going to do that by clicking on link product over here
13:30:37
okay so we've got the product right here now we're going to click on ADD variation to tell them exactly which variation we want so we know that it's
13:30:43
this one here with the alarm that cost $6 plus $11 shipping so this is the one
13:30:49
that I want to see and also here before I click on link product you can see that this box here is checked in add to
13:30:55
unfulfilled orders and this is important because I do have an unfulfilled order for this product and I want this new
13:31:02
variation from this new source to link to my product in the orders page because
13:31:07
I'm going to automate this order so when the system automates this order I want the system to process it with the right
13:31:13
product so I am going to leave this tied in add this product to my unfulfilled order so that that is the one that will
13:31:20
process from there and you can see right here the product has been linked successfully so now if I go back to the
13:31:26
orders page all right and we can see here now that the alarm door stopper is
13:31:32
now linked so it linked with the new product that we got and now instead of
13:31:38
the supplier Source being AliExpress you can see the DS icon right here this means that the supplier is now autods
13:31:45
private suppliers because it was sourced through autod DS's private suppliers okay so that's great we know that the
13:31:51
quantity here is two and we've got the rest of the customer information right here like the customer's name and
13:31:57
address and which store it's sold on I'll go over the whole orders page soon right now let's just process the orders really quick you can see that the profit
13:32:04
here the buying profit price is $34 it's going to be even cheaper now because we did Source it at a cheaper price so we
13:32:10
can see that now that we're sourcing it for around $17 with shipping The Source price is now $34 because the customer
13:32:17
ordered two units so 17 * 2 is 34 and the total buying price is $76 so we're making a profit of about $40 here now of
13:32:25
course we did have more expenses we had the ad spend and we have just a few transaction fees from Shopify really
13:32:31
small but we have to take those into consideration too I will show you the whole breakdown later in this video how much we spent how much money went out
13:32:38
how much money went in but we're still in the middle of everything but this is how much profit we're making from this
13:32:44
order not including those expenses as well but this just comes to show you that this is what Drop Shipping is all
13:32:50
about you purchase at a low price and you sell at a much much higher price and you will keep of course the profit in
13:32:57
the middle and after we take everything into consideration we will see exactly how much profit we made but it's just
13:33:03
nice to see that you can buy low sell high and that is what the model is all about all right so this product is now
13:33:10
linked you can click on review sourcing to see the sourcing that you got you can click of course on request sourcing to
13:33:16
get a new source request like for this fir is Trio product but in this case I'm just going to process the orders right
13:33:21
now so you saw that I did add automatic orders because I do want the system to
13:33:27
automate these orders for me I'm going to go over the whole orders page soon and everything that you see here and how
13:33:33
everything works and what the differences between fulfilled by Auto DS to automatic orders to just processing everything manually but for now you
13:33:40
already saw everything that I did that led me up until this point so let me just process these orders really quick I
13:33:45
already opted into the fulfilled by autods service I already topped up my balance which as you see is $81 instead
13:33:51
of$ 100 because I was at AG negative 17 or $18 before I loaded my balance and I
13:33:56
have Auto order credits which is another thing that you need each order cost One auto order credit so you'll need to
13:34:02
click on buy credits and add credits to your account your account already comes with around 30 free auto order credits
13:34:09
something like that if I'm not mistaken so you can take advantage of those and after those run out of course purchase more each one cost just a few cents and
13:34:16
that's it you've got that you've got the balance you opted into automatic orders fulfilled by autods the last thing
13:34:21
that's left to do is to switch the status from pending to send to Auto
13:34:27
order and now you can see that the system is going to process the order there's this icon right here that just showed up completed by the fulfilled by
13:34:34
autods service Okay so that is great I don't need to do anything I don't need to go to my supplier's website I don't
13:34:39
need to add my payment information I don't need to add to card and check out and put in the customer's address and do
13:34:45
everything manually the system will now process the order and ship it from my sourcing straight directly to the
13:34:52
customer's address and the status will also change as well to ordered once it's ordered with the order ID shipped with
13:34:58
the tracking information once tracking is available delivered once it's delivered and that is all there is to it
13:35:04
so I will do the same for the second order here instead of making I can make a sourcing request but I waited too long
13:35:11
to record this video and show you guys how everything works so I'm already on two days without selling this product
13:35:16
again I'm going to go over all the columns later I'm just going to process this order and show you how easy it is you just click on the status and move it
13:35:22
from pending to send to Auto order now there's a lot more tips and tricks that we can go over for example how to not
13:35:29
send it to Auto order and look as I'm speaking it's already being ordered I'm not doing any edits any Cuts look 3
13:35:36
seconds these two products were ordered and again this is 100% transparent I did
13:35:42
not cut the video no transitions as I was speaking to you guys after sending the status to send to Auto order it took
13:35:50
less than half a minute these products are already ordered and it's already on the way to the customers so as I
13:35:57
mentioned so we've got $40 profit here almost $10 profit on the Fus Trio and
13:36:02
let me just refresh the page because I want to see the actual profits because that updates after we refresh okay there
13:36:10
we go so the Fest Trio after we added in shipping it came out to be $8 in profit
13:36:15
and the alert Guard Pro came out even cheaper it came out to be $28 which is much cheaper than what I
13:36:22
expected we were probably able to get even a cheaper price for this product so that is absolutely amazing so I'm even
13:36:29
happier now because we just made $45 in profit from that one order that is absolutely great so that's how fast it
13:36:37
is to get these orders sent out and we can see the delivery date right here okay so the two orders are processed
13:36:43
we're happy about it it was automated and I'm going to go over more order automation soon I'm going to show you guys more tips and tricks for example
13:36:50
how to get the orders sent out automatically as soon as they come in no pending status just goes straight to
13:36:55
Auto order even though in my case I do like to Source my products and as long as you're looking for better suppliers
13:37:01
better products I highly recommend to use the sourcing feature and have the orders coming and pending but again it's
13:37:07
super super easy and now that we have these orders here on Shopify we really
13:37:12
do not need to touch them so Mark and Francis are both going to get their products from order automation we do not
13:37:19
need to touch Shopify we don't need to do anything there when tracking is available it will be updated on the system and it will also update on our
13:37:25
Shopify stores and again there's more things in order automation that I want to show you guys but I do want to take
13:37:30
it step by step I will reach that soon but I hope that you now see how easy it is to get your products and fulfill them
13:37:38
as fast as possible and get them with better sources better agents better sourcing faster shipping cheaper prices
13:37:45
private suppliers sales coming in I'm happy about it and I can't wait to take the next steps with you guys in the
13:37:52
following sections in this video so I hope that you're having a great time so far remember to like and share this
13:37:57
video If you appreciate the value comment down below # Shopify let me know what is your top takeaway what did you
13:38:03
learn and I will also send you this amazing cheat sheet that I created for this very video with all of the tools
13:38:10
and resources that I'm giving away we are having some nice success so far and let's keep it going okay so back to
13:38:16
Facebook ads now remember how I had the issue where I already created my first ad and I did it through the Facebook
13:38:24
page right so through the prime jungle Facebook page I just had an option to create an ad there and you can just
13:38:30
boost your post you can select a post that you already have and simply boost that one or just create more ads from
13:38:36
your Facebook page so one way to run Facebook ads is through that Facebook page where you want to run ads from now
13:38:44
another place to do it is through the Facebook ads manager so you already created your made a business account or
13:38:50
your Facebook business account I already sent you the link to that also inside the Shopify cheat sheet so creating this
13:38:56
business account is free you're just going to add your business details or your personal details and also payment information and my ad pretty much got
13:39:05
stuck after I finished creating it because the credit card that I had on file was not in the same location as the
13:39:14
business account so anyway Facebook just wanted to verify the details and make sure that the card owner is in the same
13:39:20
location as the business now because my credit card was issued in the US and I am not located there at the moment so
13:39:27
this is where Facebook kind of like raiseed the red flag and all I did was I simply removed that credit card and I
13:39:33
added another one of course local credit card and this way it got approved within a second so keep that in mind as well
13:39:40
this is something new they didn't really used to do this before but things are Dynamic and they change all the time so again just use a credit card that's
13:39:46
issued locally and not from another state or country cuz Facebook can actually see that so what I want to do
13:39:52
now is I'm going to run the ad again but don't worry everything that we did when I created that ad is still pretty much
13:39:58
the same so you can go with that tutorial I'm going to pretty much do the same thing here only through the ads manager and not from the Facebook page
13:40:05
page at the end the ad is still going to be run from that Facebook page you will see soon but I'm simply doing the same
13:40:12
thing from a different place and the reason that I'm doing that is for one main reason you may have remembered that
13:40:19
when I created the ad from the Facebook page I had to select a campaign goal of course but there was no goal for driving
13:40:27
sales and conversion so I went with getting more website visitors which is fine and I don't mind running the ad
13:40:33
like this as well I also o ran ads with the goal of view content and that also drove in sales from other products just
13:40:40
from viewing the content I just want the customer to view the content and they actually went in and purchased and you're also going to get purchases from
13:40:46
traffic campaigns but I am trying to take the shortcut again it's a little bit more expensive in the beginning
13:40:51
because the platform doesn't know where to find them it's much easier for the platform whether it's Facebook or Tik Tok or anyone else to find you cheap
13:40:58
traffic that will just engage with your post or maybe give you a link click okay but sales conversions are much harder
13:41:03
for the platform to find in the beginning where we already talked about that so I'm not going to go over it again but I still want to start with a
13:41:09
purchase campaign and because Facebook doesn't give you that option when you're trying to run ads from the page and I
13:41:14
think there's probably a good reason why they're not giving you that goal here because it's hard for them to find that audience you should start with a funnel
13:41:21
of getting more website visitors as I also mentioned before here so either getting more website visitors or getting
13:41:26
people to engage with your ad and here the pixel is going to start Gathering data okay these are the types of people
13:41:31
I know where to find them but now let's see who's actually you know from these people who we know are going to engage
13:41:37
with your ad or or click on the link on your website let's see which of those people that we have that data on are
13:41:44
actually going to take that action on your ad and once they do then we'll know even better what type of people they are
13:41:50
what types of audience and now it's going to be even easier for us to find more so anyway like I mentioned before the more data you give the pixel whether
13:41:56
on Facebook Tik Tok or anywhere else the better the results are going to be down the road but if you do not have the time
13:42:02
like me at the moment or you don't have the luxury you don't have the budget to run multiple ads starting from the top
13:42:08
of that funnel so starting from website visitors or traffic and then view content and then add to card and then
13:42:14
purchase and going down that whole thing so just do what I'm doing and start with a conversion campaign okay it is a
13:42:20
shortcut the beginning is going to be a little bit Rocky when you don't see results right away but once you start to see them it starts to get better and
13:42:26
better okay so what I'm going to do here from the ads manager is I'm going to create a new ad now I already have these
13:42:32
two existing ads this is for a different product that I ran a while ago so just don't pay attention to these what I'm
13:42:38
going to do now is click here on create to create a new ad and now you can see
13:42:44
let me just zoom in a bit so you guys can see it better now you can see that we have awareness traffic engagement
13:42:50
leads app promotion and sales so if you've got the time if you've got the budget and what I like about Facebook is
13:42:57
that you can run $5 a day ads so it's really cheap and if you're going to run $5 a day ads on traffic or awareness
13:43:05
you're going to get a lot of awareness and traffic and also engagement these are really cheap audiences so if you've
13:43:12
got the time in budget I would suggest starting with traffic and engagement just for a day or two okay just so that
13:43:19
you'll get traffic to your store the picture will start warming up with data with people who are relevant for your product okay but again I'm just going to
13:43:25
go directly with sales so after you run a traffic go to engagement after you do engagement you'll probably have some add
13:43:31
to cards you'll probably have some view content so you can run another a campaign on that and then after that you
13:43:37
can run a campaign on sales so you're slowly going down the funnel and your sales are going to come in much smoother
13:43:42
much easier that way but it is going to be more expensive look both ways are more expensive at the start because
13:43:47
you're spending money before you're actually getting anything and with going down the proper funnel You're simply
13:43:53
going to get much much better data and once you actually reach that sales campaign you're going to be making it
13:43:59
much faster much easier than starting up right away from sales okay so remember that there's pros and cons to everything
13:44:05
thing but this is what I'm going for and you can do it your own way if you want to go straight to sales do it like me if
13:44:10
you want to go down the regular funnel you can do that as well and when you finally reach sales it will be better
13:44:15
okay so we are going with sales and I'm going to click on continue okay so now we're creating a campaign with the goal
13:44:21
of driving as much sales as possible okay now choose a campaign setup a lot of these things I'm just going to skip
13:44:26
through because I already did it okay so I'm just going to move a little bit faster now we're not going to do Advantage Plus we're going to do a manual sales campaign click continue
13:44:33
okay now it's pretty much very similar to what we saw on Tik Tok remember when I was creating a Tik Tok ad I told you
13:44:38
that you're going to notice a lot of similarities between Tik Tok campaigns and Facebook campaigns so first is the campaign name I'm going to start with um
13:44:45
the pet steam brush so it's the firest trio so this is the firest trio campaign
13:44:51
or just call it fist Trio okay special ad categories no need continue scroll
13:44:56
down no Advantage Plus leave everything here off no AB testing and we can move
13:45:02
on to the next page so the only thing that we did in campaign was just give it a name okay now we're we're on the ad
13:45:08
set or what Tik Tok calls the ad group so here we're doing the placements right the audience targeting and all of that
13:45:14
so here the ad set name or the ad group name is once again
13:45:19
firest Trio and also I'm going to call it USA and you can also do the same
13:45:25
thing when you're running the Tik Tok ad so here's why I'm doing it here is because later when you want to add more
13:45:31
countries to your targeting right cuz I'm starting only with the United States and you can start start with multiple countries if you want but I do want to
13:45:37
start dedicated on one country see how that works then move on to the next one and put a set budget for each one
13:45:42
because what happens if you put a budget and then you put a lot of options right then what happens is Facebook or Tik Tok
13:45:48
or whatever they're going to be allocating your budget and they're going to be splitting it between all of the options that you gave them and once they
13:45:54
see that one option is working they're going to keep putting the budget into that while just putting a little bit of a budget into the rest of the things but
13:46:01
the rest of the options are not going to get the attention that they probably deserve because because it's just putting more Focus onto whatever they
13:46:07
see that works so that could be good but it could also be not so good because they're not testing the others enough so
13:46:13
that is why I'm going to test the USA and then what you can do is duplicate the USA ad group and do the same thing
13:46:20
for your other top TR selling countries like Australia New Zealand Canada United
13:46:27
Kingdom all of those are other great options to add to USA targeting but I do
13:46:32
want to split it I want to take as much advantage as I can into each and every country so this one is only going to be
13:46:38
called USA and that's how I can differentiate between the different ad groups another way to differentiate
13:46:43
between them is the audience targeting but I'm not going to be making any changes there so I'm just going to leave all of that here all right let's go on
13:46:49
nothing here has changed so far it's all pretty much the same as the ad that we ran on the page the only difference is
13:46:56
here instead of website visitors I'm going for direct conversion sales campaign okay so let's scroll down so
13:47:03
the conversion choose where you want to drive sales it's on my website of course the performance goal maximize number of
13:47:09
conversions so of course we're going to leave it at that the pixel is my Prime jungles business pixel I already tested
13:47:15
the events on it on the first ad that I tried to run from the page now the conversion event here is on add to card
13:47:21
on default I'm not sure why but what I'm going for here is purchase so we're going to change it over to purchase
13:47:28
continue scrolling down and now we are on budget and schedule so this of course is a daily budget that we want to set
13:47:34
for these ads that we're going to run so right now we're in the ad group and it's similar to Tik Tok where Tik Tok gets
13:47:40
your daily budget from the ad group and it's spends that budget on the ads so if you've got one ad group and five
13:47:46
different ads it's going to split that budget In Those ads and see which ones start to work and it's going to put more
13:47:53
money into the ones that work and put less budget into the ones that don't really work so I've got $20 per day here
13:48:00
and I'm going to run three ads for every product so on Tik Tok it was $30 per day split into three different um ads here I
13:48:08
will make it a little bit smaller I just want to make sure that the data works good first I don't want to put way too
13:48:14
much up front I want to get to the point here where I'm breaking even and then I want to move into the profit zone so
13:48:20
here I will move a little bit slower Facebook also has a lot more data than
13:48:25
Tik Tok because it's just been here for way way longer so we could do more with the money that you give it even though
13:48:31
it's kind of Vice Versa because Tik Tok once you so so bad at the moment because they're looking to take over the world
13:48:37
right they want all the sellers and everyone who is running ads to move over to their platform so they're trying to
13:48:43
also spend your budget and show it to as many people as possible but Facebook still has more people more data so I
13:48:49
will start with $20 also because now I am a little bit smarter I know how to Target my audiences better and I want to
13:48:56
see what it's going to do with these $20 after a couple days and then decide how I'm going to take it Forward I want to
13:49:01
be more careful now so that like I said I can get to that break even and move into that profit Zone okay so we're
13:49:08
going to give it $20 and I could change that I could make it 30 I could make it 50 I will update you within the next
13:49:14
following days what I'm doing with this budget but this is how I want to start that now so $20 and that is going to be
13:49:20
split into the ads that we are going to run in the next page okay and again for start and end date we're not going to
13:49:26
preconfig that we want the ad to start and we will decide when to turn it off we do not want to turn off a campaign
13:49:32
that is working well just because we reconfigured that we don't want to ruin our great working ads then we've got the
13:49:39
audience control so here I'm going to click on show more options because I do want to set things like the age range
13:49:45
according to the data that I already have from Tik Tok so what I want to do is optimize the Facebook ads a little bit more from what I learned when I ran
13:49:52
the Tik Tok ads for these products okay so next the location is United States we already know that and now is the minimum
13:49:59
age so let's remember let's go back and see what the age range was for the fmus
13:50:05
trio okay for the winning ad because that for me is the perfect example of what this needs to be all right this is
13:50:11
the ad that got the purchase okay and to see the results the age range and all of
13:50:17
that we're going to click on the campaign and from the campaign we are going to click on view data for that ad
13:50:23
for that campaign for that product then we're going to click here on audience okay so this one worked from
13:50:31
around 25 all the way to even more than 54 I'm going to give it I would give it
13:50:37
25 to 65 okay so we don't need any
13:50:42
18s 25 and it's only giving me the minimum age which I don't really like this is
13:50:48
again is something relatively new to Facebook and I think it's probably doing that because of this Advantage Plus again it's new they're adding Ai and
13:50:54
they want AI to do the work for us we do not want that I'm not saying that AI is bad but we're still in beta stages and
13:51:00
we want to be very fragile with our spending especially in the beginning so here I'm going to click on switch to
13:51:06
original audience and now they're like hey man are you sure this is what's going to happen and yeah I'm sure I'm
13:51:11
going to go back to the original audience and let's see if we can make it better okay here we go so this is what
13:51:16
we were looking for thank you Facebook for hiding that for us so now we're going to scroll down here and now again
13:51:22
we got the uh location so United States and now it's 252 65 plus let's do until 64 okay cuz
13:51:31
65 plus could also be 70 and 75 I don't know how many 75y olds we got on Facebook but that's just probably going
13:51:37
to be a waste of money so 25+ 64 is good and gender we saw that both male and female are perfect for this product and
13:51:44
now we've got the demographics interests and behaviors so we do want to keep it
13:51:49
relatively broad so what we said so we said that we're just going to do cats okay so interesting cats dogs as well
13:51:57
even though I'm not completely sure because we didn't have any dogs in the video but I'm hoping that people who
13:52:02
will see the videos on the cats will also understand that it's good for the for your dogs in any case if Facebook is
13:52:08
shooting to uh dog audiences and it sees that there're not getting anything from there it's going to show it more to the cats or whatever is working and I'm also
13:52:15
going to add pets okay so now the audience size is pretty good your audience selection is fairly broad
13:52:21
between 80 and a half to 94 million that's actually not fairly broad that is super super broad Facebook is not going
13:52:28
to show the add to this many people I'm not giving it that much money but again I do want to be more broad than before
13:52:34
it did prove to work when I ran the Tik Tok ads and I know that if I would continue to run those ads for longer
13:52:40
they will be more optimized and shoot it to a better and better audience so let's already Implement that here so I'm not
13:52:46
selecting any interests I am selecting some interests but I'm still keeping it fairly broad all right so up until now
13:52:52
everything is good and now let's continue to the last option in the ad group or in the ad set which is
13:52:58
placements and again I don't want no AI doing this for me the only place that I
13:53:03
want this to be on is Facebook so I clicked on edit right here and then instead of Advantage Plus playment no
13:53:10
thank you we're going to click on manual placements they're going to try to convince us again to use AI to spend our
13:53:16
money and we're going to say no and here on placements is again where it's going
13:53:21
to show this ad only on Facebook or also on Instagram Audience Network messenger and all of that so the only thing that
13:53:27
we want to have on here is stories and reals because this is the aspect ratio
13:53:33
that we were working on anyway every other placement here will require a different ratio which means that the
13:53:39
video resolution is not going to be perfectly in place and we do not want that so what I'm going to do here is I'm
13:53:46
just going to UNH highlight everything so untick every box except for stories and reals and I will only keep feeds
13:53:53
active just to show you the difference what it's going to look like then I'll go back and I'll fix it okay so for now
13:53:59
I'm going to leave it only on feeds and stories and Reals in the end we'll keep it only on stories and reals and let me
13:54:04
show you soon why okay so everything else is good we're going to click on next and start working on the ad itself
13:54:11
okay so we finished the campaign we finished the placements or the adset slad group now we are doing the ad okay
13:54:17
so this is the first creative and the first one is going to be our winner from
13:54:23
fish Trio so let's click on the ad from the Tik Tok ads and this is the winner
13:54:28
so my cats are in love with this grooming brush so my cats are in love
13:54:34
that's this copy okay next we're going to scroll down under identity choose your Facebook page okay so Prime jungle
13:54:42
and let's scroll down add setup okay so we can create a new ad or use an existing post now you can use an
13:54:50
existing post but I would like to change the text around a bit so I'm just going to create a new ad in my case and then
13:54:56
we're going to go with manual upload we're uploading the video and here we're going to go with single image or video
13:55:03
and we're going to take off multi- Advertiser ads the reason that I don't like that is let me see if we got an
13:55:08
image here what it looks like yeah so it looks like this so you're going to see an ad right from another competitor
13:55:14
right here and then if he clicks on right then they could see your add here so you're kind of like being added to
13:55:19
this CYO cell where you're going to be like somewhere on the right side you're probably not going to be on the front page and then you're just wasting money
13:55:26
on Impressions because no one even saw your ad and you had to waste money on that okay so we're going to turn off
13:55:32
multi- Advertiser ads we always want to be in the front and center okay then
13:55:37
next in add sources so we we don't need to choose anything here just keep it on none Source URL also it's only relevant
13:55:44
if you're under ad sources so we're not going to add anything there now here on the ad creative so we're going to go
13:55:50
with a video ad and this is where we're going to upload the video okay so first is the text so the text here is my cats
13:55:58
it was in love but I'm going to try my cats are obsessed with this new cat
13:56:05
brush okay and the headline look they're like adding this AI all the time cat alert is your kitty
13:56:12
shedding everywhere I just found a game-changing brush that's got my fur babies perfectly obsessed say goodbye to hairball so they're just taking whatever
13:56:19
you put here on the primary text and like okay let's make a text variation for it you can use it if you want but
13:56:25
I'm going with the original especially when you got too many line breakes um you want to keep it short don't put too
13:56:30
much text in the ad copy you want the customer to see you want the Shopper to see the video see what the product is
13:56:36
about decide right there if they want it or not they do not have to read a whole book in order to decide okay so I'm
13:56:41
going to untick apply all text variations notice how they're trying to push it they're trying to force it we
13:56:47
get what they're trying to do here but we want to do the testing we want to be in control okay next is the headline so
13:56:54
here you get some examples okay from the AI tool okay but again I'm just going to go with cats are in love with this brush
13:57:03
okay and then we got the uh description so I can write something really quick here like get yours now with fast and
13:57:10
free shipping and the call to action is going to be to buy it now so we are
13:57:18
looking for we can either be shop now or order now I'm going to put it on order
13:57:23
now okay and we should be good click on next now we need to upload the video so this is a different product that I ran
13:57:30
ads on um earlier so now of course I'm going to go to the the exports file under video ads pet steam brush
13:57:40
exports and we're looking for my cats F in love it was pet steam brush 5 if I'm
13:57:46
not mistaken okay so the video was uploaded and you see this uh yellow exclamation
13:57:51
mark here this video will be masked on mobile news feed Instagram feed Instagram explore Instagram profile feed
13:57:57
and it's all because of the aspect ratio so that is why in the placements we took out everything we disqualified
13:58:03
everything unti every box except for the Facebook feed cuz that is the perfect
13:58:09
place to run our ads with the aspect ratio that we worked on and anyway we came here for Facebook and not to dance
13:58:14
at a thousand different weddings okay so we're going to choose that click on next and here is the video editor if you want
13:58:21
to make any trims but we don't need to do that because we already edited the video okay now we need to select media
13:58:27
crop for placements because the cropping is not good as I mentioned if it's not going to be anywhere inside the stories
13:58:33
in so we can see here stories and reals when we chose our placements in the ad group settings so we can see that the
13:58:39
aspect ratio here is perfect and this is what we came here far when we edited these videos on our video editing
13:58:45
software here on feeds it does not look that good you will have some some uh black borders here on the sides and on
13:58:52
the right column also does not look good at all and this is because we also chose feed so remember how I told you that I'm
13:58:58
also going to choose feds just to show you the example of why we do not want to keep that and we only want to have have
13:59:04
stories and reals because this is what the viewers are going to see and it's just not good you want to keep the aspect ratio perfect in place we do not
13:59:11
want to see very small ads where we can barely see what's going on with a whole bunch of borders on the sides so I'm
13:59:17
just going to go back really quick and cancel the feeds and we're going to keep only stories and reals I just wanted you to have this visual representation to
13:59:25
help you understand why okay so I'm just going to click on cancel and now I'm just going to click here on the add
13:59:31
group just to make changes there and let's scroll down to the placement section and here we're going to turn off
13:59:37
feeds and leave on only stories and reals okay I will turn off Messenger and
13:59:43
we can keep it on Facebook and Instagram that is fine as long as the aspect ratio
13:59:48
is perfect so now I'm going to click on next again CU all the other settings are saved and now let's go back to the add
13:59:55
copy so that was right here so let's just do that again so add media video it
14:00:01
does save everything so I'm just going to see the text here by the way you can add more texts okay so add text option
14:00:07
and try more primary text try more headlines and Facebook will kind of do this AB testing for you and select which
14:00:13
one is working the best okay so this is the video that we uploaded we clicked on next and now you can see that there is
14:00:19
no issue with the cropping and the aspect ratio and all of that so
14:00:24
everything looks good we can click on my cats are in love with this new grooming brush and yeah we've already seen this
14:00:30
plenty of times everything is in the right place so click on next and here again Facebook wants to optimize with
14:00:36
the help of AI I'm just going to turn that off thank you but no thank you and we're going to click on done okay so now
14:00:43
our copy is ready and here is what it's going to look like so you can see it here on Facebook and here on the right
14:00:50
side is what it looks like on Instagram and in both cases it looks great we also have another option another preview
14:00:56
right here from Facebook reals so here we're looking at a Facebook story or an Instagram story this is an Instagram
14:01:02
real and this is a Facebook re so I can see that everything is in place and we
14:01:08
can continue down I just want you guys to keep something in mind because I know I'm showing you for the second time how
14:01:13
to run a Facebook ad you can go with the first option as I showed it it's perfectly fine and you can run the ad
14:01:19
from the page even if it's on traffic and on conversions and even though you didn't have all the options that you
14:01:24
have here at the end of the day there is more than one way to do things so you can choose to run the ads from the page
14:01:29
as I showed you or to run it from the ads manager which gives you a little bit more options a little more flexib ability as you're seeing now look at the
14:01:36
end of the day you're going to run ads you're going to get data and you're going to decide what is working and what
14:01:41
is not according to the data that you have there's more than one way to do things and it's fine to stay super
14:01:46
dynamic in this business model that is the best way to move forward so remember
14:01:51
that there are more than a few options to do things and that is perfectly fine you need to go with one method check it
14:01:57
out then you can try another method see which one works best and don't ever stick to only one way one method one
14:02:04
strategy and don't stick to just one thing that one person is telling you to do the more testing that you'll do the
14:02:11
more results you'll see that you're going to get and the better that they will get the more that you will try okay I've said enough I know I just want you
14:02:17
guys to be comfortable with what you're doing and know that the more you do it the better your results are going to be
14:02:23
okay so let's continue so after adding our ad creative and after adding the call to action which is order now we are
14:02:30
going to scroll down to the destination so of course we want to send people to our website this is for the firmus trio
14:02:37
so let's go to our website click on firmness Trio grab that URL and paste it
14:02:43
right over here then you've got the display link so here Facebook is like okay this is where we're going to send
14:02:49
your audiences right and first we're going to click on preview URL to make sure that we didn't make a mistake there but now they're asking okay but what he
14:02:56
wants to show the customer on what your url is your display link okay so here I'm just going to put it on Prime
14:03:02
jungle. store SL perm okay this doesn't matter that that the URL is not this but
14:03:07
I want them to see that we have our own domain and that this is the name of the product so I don't mind that they see that this is the URL even though when
14:03:14
they click on it they're going to go to this one which is of course our product page okay leave everything else ticked
14:03:20
off as is and scroll down languages you can keep that off that's fine and under
14:03:26
tracking of course is your pixel make sure that you do have a pixel connected the pixel is worth so much money once we
14:03:32
start feeding it data it's going to have so much value in it so even if you run ads and you don't make any sales you
14:03:38
still have a lot of data that you can use now and this data is what you spent your money on so you can kind of see it
14:03:44
that way not just think ah I just spent 10 bucks or 20 bucks and I didn't make any sales and everything just went to
14:03:50
waste and I'm mad about that nah everything didn't go to waste because now you have better data now you know
14:03:56
what works and what doesn't work now you're smarter in in what you can do with the data that you got from the link
14:04:01
clicks or the view content you can create custom audiences so anyway we can get to all of that later but we always
14:04:07
want to have the pixel activated so we know that our pixel works you can see the Green Dot right here I already
14:04:13
tested triggered uh test events earlier in this video you saw me do it and how it connects and how everything works and
14:04:19
that is pretty much it we are good to run so quick recap we went to the campaign all we did there was just give
14:04:25
it a name then we went to the ad group or the adet where there we gave it the audience placements and the platform
14:04:32
placements and the a targeting and now we worked on the creative inside the ad so the ad once again connected to the ad
14:04:39
group connected to the campaign and now we are ready to run this ad with a daily
14:04:44
budget of $20 per day I will duplicate this ad and add the other two copies as
14:04:50
we know and that way the budget is going to be split between these three ads and
14:04:55
let's do some AB testing so Facebook and Tik Tok let's see who's going to do better with our budget and working on
14:05:01
the same video copies and see what the differences are going to be and how many sales we are going to be bringing from
14:05:06
Facebook now that we are going to be targeting our audiences a little bit better according to the results that we
14:05:12
got from running Tik Tok ads okay so everything is good here we are going to go ahead and click on
14:05:21
publish all right so add copy number one for the firmus trio is now being
14:05:26
approved by Facebook so just like you saw on Tik Tok it could take a few hours for the ad to get approved sometimes it
14:05:32
could take a couple minutes and some it could even take a couple days so we're just going to wait it out and during this time we're going to create the rest
14:05:38
of our ads so as you know this is the first ad copy so we've got The Campaign here we've got the ad set and the ad so
14:05:44
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to duplicate this ad and I'm going to make two more ads right so we've got two more
14:05:50
videos from the firmman trio just like we did on Tik Tok so same exact thing what we're going to do here is just hover over the ad just make sure that
14:05:57
you're on the ad because we're not duplicating the ad set or the campaign then we're going to click on duplicate keep current setup click on continue and
14:06:04
here we're going to duplicate it in the same campaign so just leave that there number of copies we're going to do two
14:06:10
okay because we're going to make two more copies okay so I'm going to click on duplicate and now for each copy of
14:06:16
course we are going to make the changes and the only change that we're going to make is the actual video itself with the
14:06:23
text right so you already have it here and of course we are inside the ad so you can see that we're under the same
14:06:30
campaign this is the ad group and this is the ad that we published and now we made two more copies the only change
14:06:36
that we're going to make again is the video and the texts so I'm just going to do it offline you don't need to stick
14:06:42
around for that I'm going to show you the results you already saw me doing it on my sessions on Tik Tok and you
14:06:47
already understand how to do it here so I'm just going to go ahead and run with it and I will come back there's nothing
14:06:53
that I'm going to do that you don't already know how to do so I'm just going to go ahead and do it and then of course I'm going to do the same for the alert
14:07:00
Guard Pro so there's nothing to duplicate for that we're going to create a brand new campaign so I'm going to click on Create and this time it's a new
14:07:08
campaign so I'm going to click on new campaign we're going to go for sales manual setup and of course I'm going to
14:07:14
run super fast with this one because you guys already get the point I just want to make some changes to the creatives
14:07:19
which pretty much is the age range and then I'm going to keep it super super broad just like we did on Tik Tok so
14:07:25
this one is called alert Guard Pro USA is the adset name conversion event is
14:07:30
purchase and we're going to turn off the Advantage Plus audience and switch to original and here is where we're going
14:07:37
to make the difference so again now I'm going to Target the United States but
14:07:42
here the age range of course is going to change so let's go to the Tik Tok campaign and we're going to learn from
14:07:47
the data that we already have so I'm going to click on view data on alert Guard Pro then I'm going to click on
14:07:52
audience wait for the age to load up all right so here we are looking at I would
14:07:59
say 30 30 to 60 okay maybe 25 to 65
14:08:05
let's do 25 to 65 to keep it a little bit more on the safe side so 25 to well
14:08:12
I want 65 plus so let's do 25 to 64 no interests whatsoever so we're going to keep that open and clean the only change
14:08:19
that we're going to make is narrow down the ages some more because we saw which ages are resonating with this product
14:08:25
then again here in placements we're not going to go with the Advantage Plus placements we're going to make our own placement so we're going to click on
14:08:30
edit then we're going to click on manual placements and you already know it's going to be only stories and
14:08:37
reals that's the only place where the format ratio is perfect and that's where we want the ad to be at the end of the
14:08:42
day feeds is also good uh you will have to change the aspect ratio there but for
14:08:48
me it's a short form video it's perfect for a story and a real and I don't mind leaving it there and the ad name so the
14:08:55
first successful video that we had for this one the one that gave us the sale was I bought this for my mother cap cut
14:09:03
so let's put that as well I bought this for my mother cap cut version okay everything
14:09:11
else is fine use the Facebook page Prime jungle ad setup we're going to do a
14:09:17
manual upload we're going to do a single video and on the ad creative we're going to choose video ad and now let's start
14:09:24
adding the information according to our winning copy so let's go to the add click on
14:09:31
edit and copy the text from there so the text here was keep the bad
14:09:38
guys away wherever you go the headline is going to be I bought this for my mom
14:09:45
who was traveling alone call to action is going to be shop now or order now
14:09:52
let's do order now upload the video and this is alert
14:09:58
Guard Pro 2 click on next no no need for trimming
14:10:04
no need for cropping no need for optimizations and click on done okay
14:10:11
destination so this time of course we are going for the alert c pro this is the URL and I'll just remove SL product
14:10:18
from the display link pixel is fine everything else is fine go ahead and publish and you see how easy it is to
14:10:25
repeat and rinse and repeat the process to create more ads and more ads it becomes easier the more you do it okay
14:10:31
so now what's left to do here is to of course duplicate this ad and and add the
14:10:37
other copies so same thing for here I still got a little bit more work to do you guys don't need to stick around for for me to do it you already understand
14:10:43
exactly why I'm doing it what I'm going to do so I'm just going to finish this offline really quick get three ads for
14:10:50
each product run them and come back to you with the results so that is how simple it is to run Facebook ads as well
14:10:56
and let's see how the optimization here according to the info that we got from our Tik Tok ads that we now implemented
14:11:02
here especially narrowing down on our audience targeting and going a little bit more broad with our audience
14:11:08
interests let's see how it's going to work on Facebook we'll see the differences between Facebook ads and Tik Tok ads and we'll see if now I will be
14:11:15
able to get to my break even point and break into that profit zone so I'll come back to you soon with the results okay
14:11:22
so it's only been about a couple hours later I just wanted to show you this quick update that the ads are already starting to get approved so I started
14:11:29
getting this email from uh made of for business so this is how I realized that my ads are getting approved because that was the topic of the mail so you will
14:11:36
start getting emails as soon as that happens and you can see that I got two mails so one from one hour ago and one from 43 minutes ago so it's been less
14:11:43
than a couple of hours so your ads are approved highly run your ads were approved and should begin delivering shortly so the first one was for two ads
14:11:50
and then I started duplicating and creating more ads as I said that I will do so now I got another email for the
14:11:55
rest of them and yeah so this is what the ads look like after I duplicated them and after I started to run them and
14:12:03
we can see the six uh add copies right here so remember that we have uh two
14:12:08
campaigns so if you select to see only one like only alert Guard Pro and in the
14:12:13
ad sets that's what you're going to see and in the ads you're only going to see the ad copies that are connected to that
14:12:19
so only three and if you select both campaigns then you'll see both campaigns so we'll go to the adsets we'll choose
14:12:26
that as well and now we'll see them all here okay so we've got six ads uh right now we've got two that are active so two
14:12:32
that are are spending three that are preparing so they've been approved and they will turn to active soon and in
14:12:40
review is still being in review and I think that the reason that this is staying in review for a while is because
14:12:45
there's probably a small red flag that the uh robot kind of uh tells Facebook hey you know we should have a person
14:12:52
review this and see that it's all good because first there's a robot and then there's a real person if needed and here
14:12:57
I think it's because we're giving them statistics and Facebook doesn't always always like that especially if the stat isn't true in this case it is but let's
14:13:04
see if they'll figure that out so I wrote 1 million burglaries every 2 minutes that's just the name of the ad
14:13:10
right the audience is not going to see that what they will see in this if we click on edit is the text so there are
14:13:16
over 1 million burglaries every year in the us alone and then there's uh more text that we added inside like 1 million
14:13:22
burglaries every year here's how to stay oh there it is safe and so that's where
14:13:28
they might want to jump in and see if we're you know not adding any information that's bogus because Facebook is kind of strict on hey you
14:13:35
know don't say something that isn't true even though again in this case it is and also like don't make assumptions on the
14:13:40
customer's uh health or behavior or status or anything like that so no
14:13:46
befores and afters and things like that or take this uh medicine and you'll become super skinny or super strong or
14:13:51
whatever so there are these advertising policies and I left a link to that inside the cheat sheet as well so that
14:13:57
you will be very well equipped with what Facebook allows and what they don't allow when you're running and on
14:14:03
Facebook now keep in mind that we are running a conversion campaign so that means that we are not going to see a
14:14:09
huge reach we're not going to see a lot of Impressions we probably are going to see a very high cost per impression
14:14:16
never mind now because the ad just started running of course the numbers are going to improve we're not going to see too many link clicks because that is
14:14:23
not the goal of our campaign we jump straight to website purchase and like I mentioned it's not always going to be
14:14:29
easy to start this way because the pixel has no data and it's not looking for people who like to click on websites or
14:14:36
engage in ads it's going straight for people who have purchased something before online Facebook notice that and
14:14:41
now they're trying to show this ad to them with the audience interest that we also added inside so because they're
14:14:47
looking directly for website purchases they do not always know where to start so the first couple of days are probably going to be kind of bumpy kind of Rocky
14:14:54
but from there it should start to improve so the results will come soon and I will update you on every small
14:15:00
step of the way and so let's see how Facebook ads is is going to perform when compared to Tik Tok now there might be
14:15:06
changes that we could want to make in the future for example if you remember the placements in the adets so let me
14:15:13
just open one adset really quick let's do it for the alert Guard Pro scroll all the way down and you remember the
14:15:19
placements here we did it only on the reels for Instagram and Facebook we turned off everything else now if you
14:15:25
click on this Arrow over here it'll open up everything that you have under it so under feeds if you click on that you have what types of feeds are available
14:15:33
and if you look at this message here on the right side when I go over these you see that they recommend a square or
14:15:39
vertical 4 to five videos now one thing that we can do is take the videos that
14:15:44
we have at the moment which is fitting for reals right so it's 9 to6 ratio as we can see here on the right side and we
14:15:51
can edit them on our video editing software to make them also oneon-one or
14:15:56
four to five and that way we can also put these videos on Facebook feed Instagram feed and Facebook Marketplace
14:16:02
which is another place that people go to buy things so it could also be relevant to add it there so I'm going to give it
14:16:07
a couple days I'm going to see how it works then I'm going to decide if we are going to reformat those videos I'm going
14:16:14
to show you how to do it and then we're also going to add them to those channels as well so nobody's sure what's going to
14:16:20
happen with ads and that is why I'm trying to stay super Dynamic super flexible when I'm running these ads and
14:16:26
again let's let time tell us what's going to work and what's not and I'm going to continue showing you all the
14:16:32
results and what we're going to do next okay so in an attempt to make this store profitable I spent last night running a
14:16:39
few more ads making a few more copies and I woke up to the perfect morning of
14:16:44
all of these orders that came in while I was sleeping that came from Those ads so
14:16:50
before I fulfill these orders to my customers I want to show you exactly what I did with these ads how much I
14:16:55
spent and how much real profit is coming in after all of the expenses after
14:17:00
running all of these ads and the ads are still still currently running as I speak so let's see exactly what I did and
14:17:07
where we stand at the moment and yes I also got a haircut so a lot of new things are happening and once again I
14:17:13
was so happy when I woke up this morning to see these orders that are waiting for me and these ads have only been running
14:17:19
for one night it hasn't even been a full day yet so let me take it back real quick so as I mentioned I spent the
14:17:25
other night just making more ads offline and I did learn from the examples that I
14:17:30
had from the previous ads on what worked there so we had the Facebook ads and we
14:17:35
have the Tik Tok ads and as we know on Tik Tok we had that one order from the I
14:17:41
bought this from my mother cap cut version with the AI text to speeech so we had that one conversion it did cost
14:17:48
$79. 73 for an order with a total profit of $45 so here we're about minus $35 in
14:17:56
profit but it's okay it was the first ad I was not expecting to be super profitable right from the start only to
14:18:02
gather data and learn what's working well what we should turn off and how we could continue with what is working well
14:18:08
and squeeze everything that we can out of it to make this profitable so this was the copy that I wanted to go with
14:18:14
now I'll show you the video copies that I made there I did the same thing on Facebook ads so before I jump to show
14:18:20
you the results before we fulfill the orders and calculate our total profit I just want to show you the video ad
14:18:26
copies really quick that I made from the original video that actually ended up working for us and if you remember
14:18:31
correctly on Facebook it was this one right here I bought this for my mother that I did through the vinture resolve
14:18:38
that didn't have the AI text to speech I'm not sure once again why it did not record that purchase but I'm 200% sure
14:18:46
that it came from this one because it had the highest reach this ad showed up to the most amount of people and I was
14:18:51
only running ads on Facebook at that time so there was no other place where it could have came from unless it was
14:18:57
from organic traffic because as we know I did make that YouTube channel I did upload all of the short videos here so
14:19:04
it could have came from one of these as well I do not have that data and that is simply because I do not have a clickable
14:19:10
link on my social media channels because for YouTube you need to pass verification which I probably should
14:19:16
have done by now but I was just running really really quickly but again it's really not a problem to get that done I
14:19:21
wasn't expecting to make too many sales from organic traffic anyway but it looks like we did manage to make it and
14:19:27
another thing that I did offline was I also opened an Instagram Channel because well our first set
14:19:33
from Facebook when it came to the cat product the pet firm is pro did come from an Instagram ad that we're running
14:19:40
right here through Facebook because we chose Instagram as a placement so of course Instagram is another great social
14:19:46
media channel to post our videos I only wanted to focus on a few channels in this video but really there's no reason
14:19:51
to open it on Instagram as well so I uploaded the videos here and as you can see organic video content is working on
14:19:58
Instagram as well although I didn't make the thousands and thousands of views like I did on YouTube with these videos
14:20:05
but on Instagram we're getting a few hundred views almost per every video and it does look like as we can see right
14:20:11
here that the alert Guard Pro is getting much more views than the cat product now
14:20:17
here are the extra two copies that I just uploaded so the views are just starting to pick up right now so let me
14:20:22
show you exactly what I did in these videos so I use cap cut for this and I did keep the original video right this
14:20:29
is the one that as you guys know worked pretty well and and I just made a couple of changes one is the first scene that
14:20:37
we're seeing okay so I just showed an actual Intruder a real video of a real
14:20:43
Intruder breaking into a home and then okay so that is the problem that is what we're trying to avoid and this is the
14:20:49
solution to that problem and if you guys remember correctly I do not have the alarm in the product that I purchased
14:20:55
because I purchased the wrong variation so I did have to use the alarm sound so I just downloaded that from another
14:21:01
video from the same product I exported the audio and I just kept the alarm sound from that product and also here I
14:21:08
played another video of an intruder running away after an alarm goes off so I just got these videos from YouTube I
14:21:14
search for uh Intruders breaking in burglars Breakin things like that and I
14:21:20
chose a couple of videos where it actually showed it and then I just searched Google for Youtube downloader
14:21:25
and then you paste the link of the YouTube video that you want to download and then you get the video file then I just imported that video file right here
14:21:32
I cut it exactly in the sections that I wanted to add and that is the section that we're seeing right here so this is
14:21:38
the cut as you can see I can make it longer and then we're seeing the rest of the downloaded video but that's not what
14:21:44
what we're doing here so we only want to show it at a certain spot and I put it on top of the regular video that's being
14:21:50
shown on the timeline so the one on top shows before the one on the bottom when the one on top ends the one on the
14:21:56
bottom will continue okay so let's take a look at this one and I just want you to see what I did here so so here is the
14:22:03
first video This is called Intruders broke into my mom's home and I have two hooks for this so there's hook one hook
14:22:10
two and the original video so those are the three videos that I scaled right now using Facebook and Tik Tok ads okay so
14:22:17
let's watch this variation Intruders broke into my mom's home so I bought this to scare them away it's portable
14:22:24
and easy to install if anyone tries to enter the alarm will'll go off and The
14:22:30
Intruders will run for their lives my mom is safe and no longer afraid get
14:22:36
yours now with fast shipping okay so I changed the text just a little bit
14:22:42
nothing too serious and the hook so Intruders broke into my mom's home you see the Intruder breaking in and then
14:22:49
you have the alarm door stopper or the alert Guard Pro as we called it uh just
14:22:54
minor changes to the text and of course this video of the Intruder running away once the alarm goes off okay so that is
14:23:00
the first change that I made made that's the first video that I made following the success of the original the second
14:23:07
video let me just play it directly from uh Instagram so we just watched this
14:23:14
one this is the one we just watched so this is the second one Intruders broke
14:23:20
into my mom's home so I bought this to scare them away it's portable and easy
14:23:25
to install everything else is enter the alarm will go off and The Intruders will
14:23:31
run for their lives my mom is safe and no longer afraid okay so it's just the hook in the beginning
14:23:37
okay so I just added two videos okay we can also see it right here here's the first one here's the second
14:23:44
one Okay so we've got two different hooks the rest of the video is the same so you see The Intruders breaking into
14:23:49
the home and just very minor text uh changes uh in the fonts and then we also
14:23:55
have the original video that I kept which is of course this one okay so you guys are already very well acquainted
14:24:01
and familiar with that video and so here are the ads okay so let's start with Facebook so once again I only ran these
14:24:09
ads from last night so it hasn't spent that much of my budget yet I only put $100 this time not 200 I don't want to
14:24:16
overdo it and I do want to scale slowly and also in the beginning you don't have to put hundreds and hundreds of dollars
14:24:22
as I mentioned go ahead and put the minimum daily budget and see what data you get after 3 days and one of my
14:24:28
takeaways here is when I ran my first ads I waited waited 3 days until I
14:24:33
turned them off and both of the ads that I ran on the first time on both Facebook
14:24:39
and Tik Tok they both made their sales on the third day so it takes time for
14:24:44
the data to come in and most likely you might not get sales on the first couple of days the third day is the day that
14:24:50
really tells you what's going on and if you're actually going to see any results with these ads and if you are making
14:24:56
sales then consider leaving it on and adding more videos similar to the one
14:25:02
that is working well that is exactly what I did here well I did turn off the ads because I reached my ad spend and I
14:25:08
wanted to continue with this video but now I wanted to make it profitable so I went back to the ads saw what was
14:25:14
working well and added a couple of more hooks to the video that worked the best for us I also noticed in the organic
14:25:21
videos that this video was working really well and when it came to pay-per-click marketing it proved to me
14:25:27
that that is the best video out of all the videos that I made and remember that
14:25:32
I got the video idea from another seller who is selling the same exact product I
14:25:38
didn't just come up with a sentence um I bought this for my mom who was traveling alone I probably wouldn't have been able
14:25:43
to think of that myself but when I did search for the product on Tik Tok it was very easy to find the best sellers who
14:25:50
are selling this product and it was this guy right here who got 4 million views for this video that was uploaded just
14:25:56
about a month ago and he has been uploading more and more videos every couple days he uploads another video
14:26:01
around found the same style so I bought this for my sister when she was traveling alone and if you remember I
14:26:07
changed sister to Mom just to not be a a complete copy and paste and of course I did make my own video for this and so
14:26:14
that turned out being the best video if it worked for him why shouldn't work for me as well so those are the videos that
14:26:20
I went with with the ads that I started running from last night so again let's start with Facebook ads and so the only
14:26:26
thing that I did here was I clicked on duplicate on the original ad that sold for me on Facebook so I clicked on
14:26:32
duplicate right here it opens up a duplicate in a pop-up window and then you can make whatever changes you want
14:26:37
on the duplicated ad so again I didn't duplicate the campaign I didn't duplicate the ad set I just duplicated
14:26:42
the ad that worked really well for me and I didn't change anything on the first copy so this is a direct copy of
14:26:50
this one that worked really well I didn't make any changes I just turned it on again in a duplicate the reason that
14:26:55
I duplicated and didn't just turn it on again is because I want to see fresh new
14:27:01
stats from this ad copy after running these ads for 3 Days okay so I just made
14:27:06
one complete duplicate and I turned it on and then I duplicated it twice more and the only change that I made is the
14:27:13
name right of the ad so I'll know which copy it is so this is Intruders broken into my mom's home hook two and hook one
14:27:20
so you saw the two hooks plus the original video and besides the title of the ad the only thing that I changed of
14:27:26
course is the uploaded video so here we've got the video for hook two here we've got the video for hook one everything is duplicated so I didn't
14:27:33
have to choose all of the settings over again I didn't have to choose audience placements in the adset I didn't have to choose the campaign goals in the
14:27:39
campaign and I didn't have to choose the rest of the budgets and the settings inside the ad itself I simply duplicated
14:27:45
the ad that worked well for me and I changed a title I changed the video inside everything else stays the same
14:27:51
okay so from here I did manage to make one sell so far and it might not seem
14:27:58
like a lot to you but as a cost per result of only spending $430 on this ad so far I already made
14:28:06
one website purchase so that is absolutely amazing and it was able to do
14:28:12
this I believe because it already has data from what audiences it needs to
14:28:17
search for from the first time we ran ads and remember the more you feed the pixel whether it's a Facebook pixel or
14:28:24
Tik Tok pixel the more data you feed it the easier it's going to be for that pixel to find more audiences that are
14:28:31
similar to the ones who are taking an interest in your product so that's why the more ads that we run the more
14:28:37
success we'll see down the line and it's going to be really difficult making a sell on the first day or the first
14:28:42
couple of days when running an ad for the first time on a brand new fresh pixel on a conversion campaign okay and
14:28:51
so the reason that you see this one right here is preparing is because I just made a couple of uh changes to the
14:28:57
text inside to the headline and so once you save that once you submit changes to an ad it's going to run for review again
14:29:04
and it's already been approved now it's just preparing to deliver so you can see your ad successfully passed review now
14:29:09
our delivery system is matching it to the right bid so this can take a few hours but you can see that it did run so
14:29:15
it already had a reach of 51 and it spent $8 and it only had one link click
14:29:20
and then I just made a couple of changes to the text so now it's going to get reviewed and run again soon and the one
14:29:26
that sold is Intruders broke into my mom's home the second hook so hook number two is this one right
14:29:36
here so that is the copy that's sold and it only got one link click and I think
14:29:42
that's pretty amazing because we also saw a sale from Instagram that came from Facebook ads and that Instagram only had
14:29:48
one click so when you are opting for conversion campaigns then you know that
14:29:54
you're not going to get a whole bunch of Link clicks but each link click could be of very high quality it just takes the
14:30:01
pixel time to find these audiences because you're not doing the whole funnel starting from uh website clicks
14:30:07
uh add engagement view content add to cart and slowly moving down the funnel of campaign goals when you start with
14:30:13
conversions right away it's going to take longer for it to find the data but once it finds it it's going to be easier
14:30:19
for it to find more and more that are similar to it and that is exactly the phase that we are going through right now okay so one sell came in from here
14:30:27
and we only spent $430 to get that sell so far so let's continue to see how this
14:30:33
is going to work and now let's move over to Tik Tok ads which seems to be on a much better start not a huge difference
14:30:40
but we are looking at two sales that came in from the new batch of ads so this is the previous batch and yes guys
14:30:47
I turned off the pet product it did make a few sales but it doesn't seem to be anywhere near as profitable as the alert
14:30:54
Guard Pro because of the higher price tag and because as you can see customers are purchasing more than one unit each
14:31:01
which is great it's increasing our average order value bringing us more profit per sale so here we're looking at
14:31:07
these three copies the same three copies that we have on Facebook which once again is the winning ad copy of I bought
14:31:14
this for my mother with the two additional hooks we turned off everything else because everything else
14:31:20
might have been working a little bit but not enough to make us profitable so the one that worked here so far is the
14:31:27
actual original video so the two extra hooks did not make any sells so far I'm
14:31:33
looking at zero clicks for hook number two I'm looking at one click for hook number one but again we don't have that
14:31:39
much ad spent yet this ad right here spent only $6 so far this is hook number
14:31:45
one hook number two only spent 10 cents it didn't even start spending here yet and the original video which is the same
14:31:53
exact duplicate from this original which made us our first sale so this already sold two units since I turned this on
14:32:00
last night after after just a $17 ad spend so sorry it's not two units it's
14:32:06
two purchases each purchase could have multiple units inside but here we are looking at two purchases after spending
14:32:13
only $17 on this duplicated ad copy from the first successful one that we ran we
14:32:18
just didn't really need to turn it off and again the reason that I turned it off is because I'm working through steps
14:32:24
and so I knew that after 3 days I'm going to turn off ads I'm going to fulfill orders and I'm going to move on to the next sections but I really wanted
14:32:29
to make this profitable and also show you how and I'm super glad that it's working out so I can show you exactly
14:32:35
what I'm doing and also what I'm going to do next so we have two purchases right here the cost is $17 the cost per
14:32:42
conversion is half of that because 17 divided by 2 is8 and a half so the cost
14:32:48
per each conversion right each purchase is the total cost divided by how many purchases we had and here we have a
14:32:55
total of eight clicks so it's not a lot of clicks but getting two purchases out of only eight clicks are absolutely
14:33:02
outstanding figures okay so two sales from Tik Tok one sell from Facebook one
14:33:08
is the second hook that I created yesterday and on Tik Tok it's the original video of I bought this for my
14:33:13
mother on cap cut so we're looking at a total of three ad cells but when I went over to check out my orders on autods
14:33:21
and on Shopify I noticed a lot more orders so here on autods I've got 1 two
14:33:26
3 four five six pending orders and on Shopify I have one two three four
14:33:32
pending orders so how exactly could this be let's dissect it and understand exactly what's going on here so first of
14:33:39
all let's take a look at the total number of items so the first order right here by a customer named uh Joel ordered
14:33:46
$75 94 cents worth of products so that's exactly the same as this and this order
14:33:51
so I can tell that he just ordered two units of the alert Guard Pro okay so if we just scroll down a bit here we go so
14:33:58
two units of the alert Guard Pro so it's the same as what other customers have ordered so far and the next order is
14:34:05
$37.97 so if I click on that we can see that it's the alert Guard Pro one unit
14:34:11
okay so we're looking at two units here one unit here and look at these two wonderful looking orders $1
14:34:18
15188 and $128 58 so this one right here is from William and if I click on it I
14:34:26
can see that William ordered four units of the alert Guard Pro and that's why
14:34:31
was so important to have a quantity of at least 10 for every unit that we're
14:34:37
selling on our stores it doesn't cost us any money to update the quantity and we will just make a whole bunch of profit
14:34:43
from doing so especially from this product where customers do not seem to be satisfied with just one unit except
14:34:49
for Nora here who only bought one which is absolutely fine so that is a great
14:34:54
great order for units of the alert Guard Pro and the last one right here is from
14:35:00
a customer called p Pam and if I click on that we can see exactly what they ordered so here I can see that Pam
14:35:07
ordered two units of the alert Guard Pro and also got a promotion because she did
14:35:13
use the frequently bought together promotion that we added from the frequently bought together app that I mentioned so check it out instead of
14:35:20
paying $38 she paid $ 34 but she did buy two units so it's $68 and she also
14:35:26
bought these two locks that come as one unit so one unit with two more locks here and she bought this fingerprint
14:35:33
lock two units so it looks like she's looking for two of each two alert Guard Pro two dual locks and two fingerprint
14:35:41
locks so this one comes as two units so she only ordered one and everything else is two so wonderful wonderful order
14:35:49
let's take a look at that product once again let's go to Prime jungle. Star click on the alert Guard Pro and these
14:35:56
are the extra products that she added right here so she actually saw these and said okay I don't want this uh stealthy
14:36:03
ninja door lock I guess but she did take this this and of course the alert Guard Pro she clicked on claim offer and then
14:36:10
she updated the quantities in her cart amazing and it's a good thing that we added these as well so that is the
14:36:16
fourth order so now we've got all of these unfulfilled orders now again we're not going to be using Shopify to look at
14:36:23
these orders because we have all the data here in autods and if we look here on the right we can see that here is Pam
14:36:30
these are Pam's order so one two three the first three lines are all for Pam so
14:36:36
it's the alert Guard Pro and we've got one unit of the Dual lock and two units
14:36:41
of this fingerprint lock Okay so we've got all the information right here and next we've got William right here who
14:36:47
ordered four fantastic units of the alert Guard Pro and we've got Nora who ordered one unit of the alert Guard Pro
14:36:54
and Joel who ordered two units of the alert Guard Pro so let's take a look at how much profit we're making let's
14:37:00
fulfill the order ERS but also there's a couple more things that I want to go over because something is still not
14:37:06
sitting right if we got two orders from Tik Tok ads and one order from Facebook
14:37:11
ads that's three orders from ads so one two three but here we have four orders
14:37:16
now this did happened to me before with this ad right here I don't know why Facebook did not include it as an ad
14:37:23
sell but here we do not have enough figures to say oh it probably came from this one because it's got thousands and
14:37:30
thousands of views and there's no way that it didn't make a sale since these ads just started running and they're
14:37:35
already converting now while I'm again 200% sure that this original ad made a
14:37:40
sell and for some reason Facebook did not see it even though when we went inside the ad and when we went inside
14:37:46
shopify's figures we did see that it came from Instagram but here I do not have that data so the only thing that
14:37:53
happened in the last couple of days organically is that I opened this Instagram Channel and I did the same
14:37:59
thing as I did with a YouTube channel and Tik Tok talk and everything else when it came to organic traffic I simply
14:38:04
uploaded all of the videos with the call to action to purchase the product but because I do not have a th000 followers
14:38:10
on Tik Tok I do not have a th000 followers on Instagram I didn't verify my YouTube channel none of the links are
14:38:16
clickable so the customer the online Shopper the viewer simply copies the URL
14:38:22
right here I can't believe and then they paste it on their browser and that way we do not see that they came from that
14:38:29
social media platform or anywhere else but I'm pretty confident that that extra
14:38:34
sell came somewhere from one of these videos here on the alert Guard Pro
14:38:40
because these views just came in the other day as did that sell so the data will get better as we continue working
14:38:46
on our stores as we verify our social media accounts and as we build up our followers list but I'm still happy with
14:38:51
the results even though I do not have the data of 100% of the customers that came in I've got about 90% that's good
14:38:58
enough for me to work with in the meantime all right so let's see exactly how much profit we're making and then
14:39:03
I'm going to quickly fulfill these orders as you know it's super easy I'm just going to hover over and move it from pending to send to Auto order I can
14:39:10
also highlight the orders that I would like to send out in bulk like this and bulk actions status send to Auto order
14:39:18
or I can just have it automatically done if you simply by going to the settings in autods and having both fulfilled by
14:39:25
autods and automatic orders ticked in right here in the order settings so you want to have both ticked in and that way
14:39:32
it won't come in in pending it'll get sent to automatic orders right away but I do want to review these orders with you guys before I send them out so let's
14:39:39
take a look at the total profit that we made so far and I only want to focus on the alert Guard Pro simply because ferus
14:39:46
Trio was not a very profitable item so we did some testing we found a profitable product now let's see exactly
14:39:53
how much profit we're making from it so let's see the total orders that we have from alert Guard Pro not counting the
14:39:58
first four orders which again were demo orders it's the same one on here that are unfulfilled by the way you can see
14:40:03
that the rest of the real orders that we got are fulfilled and we got tracking that was automatically added by the
14:40:09
fulfilled by autods system so we didn't really have to do anything there so next besides of course just top up our Auto
14:40:16
order balance and make sure that we have Auto order credits so let's see how much profit we made only on alert Guard Pro
14:40:23
the item that's making crazy sales and profits for us recently okay so the first sale made $45 in profit this is a
14:40:29
sourced order so we were able to to get a cheaper price and faster shipping through product sourcing and sourced
14:40:35
orders so we got $45 in profit here here is the next sell right here so we're looking at 45 plus 45 is
14:40:42
$90 and here is the third sell for alert Guard Pro here we're looking at 39 but
14:40:47
it is going to be $45 in profit because it is two units of the alert Guard Pro again and after sourcing we're going to
14:40:53
see we're not going to pay twice for shipping we're only going to pay once so it happened before from the first two orders we'll only pay once for shipping
14:41:00
meaning we're going to make more more than the profit that we have here because right now it's taking shipping twice in advance once it gets ordered it
14:41:06
will update to the right price here so the Buy price is going to be around $28 and not 34 meaning we're going to make
14:41:12
around $45 in profit so we were looking at $90 45 and 45 is 90 plus another 45
14:41:18
is $135 okay here we're looking at one unit and it's going to cost this is how much
14:41:24
it's going to cost it's going to cost around $17 if I click on review sourcing I can see how we got to that price so
14:41:30
this is when we sourced that alert Guard Pro and we can see the price right here $462 plus another $11 for shipping so
14:41:36
that is $1,562 in total and maybe another dollar and a half in tax so it's going to come out to around $17 okay so
14:41:43
we're looking at almost $20 in profit here let's round that down to about 19 so we're looking at 135 + 19 is
14:41:51
154 so now we're looking at $154 in profit and here we've got this order
14:41:57
right here so first of all let's write 154 just so that I won't forget get that number right now we're looking at $154
14:42:03
in profit only on alert Guard Pro and now we're looking at the next two orders
14:42:09
for alert Guard Pro so here's one and this is the customer that ordered four units so here the profit is going to be
14:42:16
well I'll process the orders and then I'll show you the total profit but just thinking out loud this one is going to
14:42:21
be around let's see um if for two units we're making $45 uh Dollar in profit so
14:42:28
for four units we're going to make $90 in profit um if all the calculations are correct and the profit could even be a
14:42:35
little bit higher so if for every two units we're making $45 here we're going
14:42:40
to make at least $90 in profit so let's add another 90 and I'll show you the total profit calculation after I process
14:42:47
the orders but I just want to show you the quick overview so 154 + 90 is 244 plus we've got the extra order up
14:42:54
here so here we're looking at two units so that's another $45 and we've got the extra add-ons right here which is $5 for
14:43:02
this one and about $8 for this one and I want to talk about these two in just about a minute but let's finish with the
14:43:07
profit calculation so here we're looking at another $45 plus an extra let's say $10 we'll round it down a bit so another
14:43:14
$55 right here so here we're looking at almost $300 in profit and the ad spent here is
14:43:22
220 if I'm not mistaken or maybe 240 let's see so if we go to Tik Tok and we
14:43:28
only have the alert Guard Pro ads right here we can see that the total ad spent
14:43:33
so far was $120 because the first ads that we run of course were a little bit more expensive until we finally started to
14:43:39
gather some data and results it took the pixel some time so $120 ad spend on Tik Tok plus another 118 let's round that up
14:43:48
to$ 1220 plus another $120 ad spend on Facebook so we're looking at a total of $240 in ad spend so if I subtract that
14:43:57
from here from the total profit we're looking at about $60 in in profit so we
14:44:02
are out of the nonprofit zone out of the break even Zone and now we're finally in
14:44:08
the profit Zone and this was only after one night of running optimized ads after
14:44:13
learning from our first batch of ads taking what works changing a few minor things in the video that worked the hook
14:44:20
itself and a little bit further down the video and you saw the results and so I
14:44:25
was able to turn a negative into a positive from the second batch of ads that I'm running and I cannot wait to
14:44:32
see what the results are going to be at the end of this day starting tomorrow 2 days from now so if you want to see me
14:44:38
taking this store for the long term let me know in the comments below if you are interested in it and I will continue to
14:44:43
show you the results as I continue working on this store because I'm having an amazing time so far and I'm so happy
14:44:51
that after just one night of optimization of creating optimized ads learning from what worked well for me
14:44:57
and continuing to double down on that while turning off what isn't profit even though it's making sales and ferace
14:45:03
Trio seems like a cool product and if you would have asked me what product I thought would have been the winner on
14:45:09
this store on the two that I'm testing I thought it was going to be the firest trio because everybody loves pets and
14:45:14
it's just a much cheaper product so it's easier to purchase and I just thought it was a really cool one but again what we
14:45:20
think our assumptions have nothing to do with what's actually going on in the market and that is why we have to follow
14:45:26
actionable and professional steps to see the results which is what we are seeing right here right now so I'm so happy to
14:45:34
finally be in the profit Zone we're at about $60 in profit let's fulfill these orders and continue running these ads
14:45:41
continue optimizing continue making sales and profit because we're already at a very good point right now after
14:45:47
just one night of running ads all right I've said that enough I just want to stress out what's working I want you guys to learn from it and take it take
14:45:55
this product order it to your house take another product that's similar to this one run videos on that too you guys are
14:46:02
watching live with 100% transparency right now what's going on with my store
14:46:08
and I'm leaving nothing behind all right so again one second before I fulfill these orders I just want to talk about
14:46:13
these extra add-ons because I did add those variations using different suppliers so it's not all going to come
14:46:20
in one package to our customer Pam so Pam is going to get the alert Guard Pro
14:46:25
from our private Source supplier but double trouble this product right here
14:46:30
here this one the source is Amazon you can see right here I clicked on the uh Amazon ID and you can see that this one
14:46:37
cost $9.99 and she bought it for 1621 so relatively cheap not a lot of profit for
14:46:42
me here but that's not really why I wanted to add it there in the first place and the second lock the
14:46:48
fingerprint lock is coming from AliExpress okay so you can see it right here now I could Source the AliExpress
14:46:56
product and perhaps find a cheaper one just like we did with the alert Guard Pro but because it's a relatively cheap
14:47:02
product and I want to get it out as soon as I can because Pam is not going to get all three packages at once she's going
14:47:07
to get the package for the alert Guard Pro another package for the Dual lock and another package for the fingerprint
14:47:12
lock now there's not much we can do about that because we are adding products and variant from different suppliers from a variety of suppliers
14:47:20
but then again it doesn't really matter the customer will not mind getting it in three different packages everything is going to get delivered to their door and
14:47:26
they're going to be pretty happy about that and I'm speaking from over eight years of experience doing this so don't worry if you're sending it from
14:47:32
different packages different suppliers just fulfill your orders as soon as you can so that your customers get it fast
14:47:37
and believe me they'll be happy so let's go ahead and fulfill these orders right now I'm going to do it in bulk so I'm
14:47:43
just going to highlight all of these orders click on bulk actions and send to
14:47:48
Auto order click on update and now the bulk changes have started for these products okay so now all of them are
14:47:54
going to be fulfilled the orders will get sent out automatically and it will turn to fulfilled once tracking
14:48:00
information is available it will be updated on my autods account and on my stores as well so that my customers will
14:48:07
also have the tracking information as you guys are all very well aware of and so once again I'm super happy after the
14:48:13
first night of running the optimize ads after our first batch of ads after learning from it and seeing what worked
14:48:19
best and learning from our best practices making it even better for the second batch even better for the third
14:48:24
batch and for the fourth and fifth that's when true scalability is going to happen on our stores so I'm planning on
14:48:31
taking this store for the long term let me know in the comments if you would like to see the next results for this
14:48:37
store and see exactly how much profit I'm able to make with these products that I'm selling all right so back to
14:48:43
autods we can see that everything now is in order of progress and everything is being sent out by the fulfilled by
14:48:49
autods service so again this is true automation at its finest okay so the orders have been fulfilled by the
14:48:55
fulfilled by autodia System we can see that all of the new orders from the past day or from the past night to be more
14:49:01
precise have been fulfilled by fulfilled by autods and tracking everything else
14:49:06
will get updated automatically so overall just from running ads from last night the more optimized ads we made a
14:49:13
total profit of about $190 so far less than one day after running the scaled and optimized ads
14:49:20
learning from our best practices on our winning product the alert Guard Pro from
14:49:26
a total ad spend so far of $35 so we are deep deep into the profit Zone from the
14:49:32
last night and I cannot wait to see how far I can get with this wonderful
14:49:37
winning product but from here the skies are the limit I can create even more hooks for my winning video change the
14:49:44
music up a bit change the text a little bit more and simply add more and more videos similar to the one that is
14:49:50
selling well each with its own different angle different hooks but also try to make everything really catch on and
14:49:56
resonate with the person who's viewing the video so we started off by seeing what's working well from other Sellers
14:50:02
and then I tried running ads it's a little bit expensive at first because it is running conversion campaigns my first
14:50:07
sales came in from day number three of running ads on Facebook and Tik Tok then I turned them off and then about a few
14:50:13
days later I turned them back on with the one video that worked the best for me and more optimized versions of that
14:50:18
video with different Hooks and a little bit of workaround in different text and further optimizations deeper into that
14:50:24
video if you remember seeing uh the Intruder running away when the alarm goes off so just making a little bit
14:50:29
different twists here here and there but you want the main change to be in the hook because this is the first few seconds where the viewer is actually
14:50:36
going to decide if he's interested in this product interested in this ad copy or not so you want to have a good hook
14:50:42
on a winning product on a winning video that worked for you and don't spend too much money on your ads on the first few
14:50:48
days of running them first you want to see what is actually working if something here has potential you do not
14:50:54
need to spend so much money in order to figure that out and once you do find that winner it's time to double down and
14:50:59
make it even better now besides changing the video copy besides just changing the hook you can also play around with the
14:51:05
placements you don't only have to sell to one Target location I could now
14:51:10
duplicate my ad group or my ad set and sell also to Canada New Zealand Australia United Kingdom and other
14:51:17
countries with a lot of buying power and I could also Target different audience interests even though with alert Guard
14:51:23
Pro I did go super super broad so I didn't try to Target any specific interest but I did optimize the age
14:51:29
range a bit after learning from the first ad that I ran and learned what age ranges are resonating with that product
14:51:36
so further optimizations can be done not just including the hooks but I'm so glad that I found my winner I'm so happy that
14:51:42
I was able to make it profitable and I cannot wait to see how far I can get with this winning product so again if
14:51:48
you want to see the end results what's going to happen next week and the week after and the next month just let me know in the comments below and I'll
14:51:53
share the data with you and for now let's move on so now let's go over autod DSS settings and all of the options that
14:52:00
we have here it's very crucial because this will help us save a lot of time while we're already on the verge of
14:52:06
Saving Time on our Drop Shipping businesses now we're going to make that even better by putting in the right
14:52:11
setting so every time we import a product or every time we take a certain action on our stores through autods it
14:52:17
will already be with our preconfigured settings so there's a bunch of settings to go over and I want you all to know exactly what each column does each row
14:52:25
each text field everything that we have here after we go over the settings I'm going to go over all of autod DS's menus
14:52:32
and features here on the left side as well now we did go over some of them like the marketplace when we did the product research in the beginning of the
14:52:38
session and Su in the orders page when we process the orders that we got after we rent our ads and the products page
14:52:44
some of it as well but there's a lot that we still didn't go over and there's so much more for you to learn about the system but I'd like to start first in
14:52:51
the settings because this affects everything else that you'll do in all of the other features that we have here so
14:52:57
let's understand everything in autod DS's settings so as soon as we click on that the first thing that we'll see here
14:53:03
the First Column is supplier settings so we've got all of these columns which we're going to go over we're going to
14:53:08
start right here so the supplier settings means that these are the settings that I want with these certain
14:53:13
suppliers that we're going to work with so for example first we need to select our store so this means what store will
14:53:20
these options these rules that we will configure now which store will it apply to so for us of course it's Prime jungle
14:53:27
so we're going to leave it at that and here we get to choose the supply so what store do you want these settings to be
14:53:32
configured to as well as which supplier so this means that all the settings that we will configure now are going to be
14:53:37
configured for a certain supplier so for example if you want to work with Amazon us or AliExpress us or AliExpress China
14:53:45
or from the autods marketplace using the US suppliers or from the autods marketplace using the Chinese suppliers
14:53:52
so these of course are the private suppliers and you also have the retail suppliers and if you don't have it here
14:53:58
you can just click on ADD supplier and here just choose what supplier you want to work with and configure these
14:54:04
settings for so here you have the whole list of retail suppliers as well as the autods marketplace which as you know has
14:54:10
private suppliers and you also have autods sourcing and next you also want to select the warehouse so if for
14:54:16
example you're working with AliExpress and you only want these settings to happen on Products that come
14:54:23
from AliExpress Germany cuz let's say for instance you want to work with AliExpress Germany from their German
14:54:28
Warehouse so that you can sh ship your items quickly to your German audience okay so that's just an example so here
14:54:34
you're going to choose a supplier so let's say for example I'm doing it from AliExpress China so these are the
14:54:40
settings that I want to configure for every time I have products or I'm adding products from AliExpress to my Prime
14:54:47
jungle store so the first thing that we have is the Lister the Lister is every time I list a product okay so for
14:54:54
example we're going now to AliExpress and let's say we want to list this product okay so every time I list this
14:55:00
product these settings are going to happen Okay so that's what that means first things first is the default
14:55:05
product quantity so every time we add a product from AliExpress China the default product quantity will be 10 so
14:55:12
this means that a customer at the time of purchase can buy up to 10 units of this product now what happens after he
14:55:18
buys one unit five units or 10 units then your default product quantity will go down it will decrease according to
14:55:25
the quantity that the customer ordered and then autods will bring it back up to your default product quantity
14:55:31
automatically so even if a customer buys 10 units then it's going to go down from 10 to Z but then it's going to go back
14:55:36
up from 0 to 10 and that is what the system is going to do so I'm going to leave it at default product quantity 10
14:55:42
and I also think that it's a good idea do not have only one product quantity because if a customer wants to order more than one you're not really going to
14:55:48
give them the chance to do so and that kind of proved its point when you saw how the first customer when I ran Tik
14:55:54
Tok ads B two units of the alarm door stopper thus getting an average order value of $775 and the profit there was
14:56:01
pretty nice all right so that's a default product quantity I'm going to leave it at 10 I wouldn't recommend to have anything like one or two unless you
14:56:08
think that your supplier is about to run out of stock next shipping methods so shipping methods is asking you okay
14:56:14
every time we list a product from AliExpress China to your Prime jungle store What shipping methods do you want
14:56:20
us to grab from AliExpress because in many cases AliExpress has multiple shipping methods let me see if if I can
14:56:26
find a quick example of that let me see if I can find a quick example of that okay so let's open up like this item
14:56:33
right here this plush duck dog toy so I'm going to click here on the shipping to see what the shipping methods are
14:56:39
What shipping options we have for this product and here we can see that we have free shipping which is nice but tracking
14:56:46
is unavailable and we do not want to add orders where we cannot add tracking information we always have to have
14:56:52
tracking so that we can prove to our customers or show our customers where the package is and we won't have to send
14:56:57
them a refund if they see that they didn't get it because we also really have proof we have to have tracking information available so make sure that
14:57:04
you're always choosing shipping with tracking available unless you want to take the risk of sending refunds if
14:57:09
customers claim that they did not get the product now if they claim that they didn't get the product and you have tracking information available you can
14:57:15
always check that with the tracking info and then you can reach out to your supplier and say hey here's the tracking info the package got lost or damaged
14:57:23
returned to seller it just didn't reach its destination and this way that your supplier is going to either send you a
14:57:28
refund or resend the product whatever it may be but you want to have tracking in order to have Seller Protection and also
14:57:34
buyer protection so here we have free shipping but tracking is unavailable so we actually wouldn't want to choose this
14:57:40
option the next option is shipping which cost $1.78 but here tracking is available now
14:57:48
here's the thing it's not just $1.78 for getting tracking which is the important part you're also going to get the
14:57:54
product much much sooner if you choose free shipping without tracking then the
14:58:00
shipping carrier Kow super economy Global is going to supply this it's
14:58:05
going to deliver the product on December 20th that's about 2 months from now that is crazy you should never never choose
14:58:11
such an option but then for $1.78 it's going to arrive in a couple of weeks and it's going to cost $1.78 and tracking
14:58:18
information is available so this is the one that youd actually want to go for then there's another option shipping for
14:58:24
59 but here it's not very fast the delivery is November 23rd to 27th so
14:58:29
that is about four or 5 weeks away from now so just because the shipping is like a120 cheaper and it has tracking doesn't
14:58:37
mean that it's worth it because we want to deliver our products quickly and even if our customer expects to get the
14:58:43
product within 2 weeks and they get it within 2 days they're going to be really happy about that and there's a high
14:58:48
chance that they're either going to come back return to your store and purchase again or refer some of their friends and
14:58:53
their family to purchase from your store because they see that you are doing good fast and efficient business so in this
14:58:59
case I would which is $1.78 but when you're adding this product to autod DS how do you tell the
14:59:04
system which shipping option to take into consideration because autod DS wants to also know how to price this
14:59:10
product does it cost $342 or does it cost $342 plus
14:59:15
$1.78 so how does a system know which shipping option to take into consideration that is why we've got the
14:59:21
shipping methods so cheapest is not my recommendation because in cheapest it
14:59:27
would have chosen this option right here free shipping and it would get delivered within two months the other option is
14:59:33
cheapest with tracking and the third option is fastest with tracking so in
14:59:39
this case fastest with tracking is the winner because it is this option right
14:59:44
here it's the fastest because it gets delivered the earliest the soonest and it has tracking available in most cases
14:59:51
though you'd want to go with cheapest with tracking and that is simply because usually the cheapest with tracking is
14:59:58
the best option most shipping carriers deliver relatively quickly with the cheapest option here in this example
15:00:03
cheapest with tracking isn't really the best option as we can see right here because it's going to arrive within a
15:00:10
month and a week but even if the system would have taken the 59 cents right because we went with chapus with
15:00:16
tracking which is still my personal recommendation because in most cases you will see that this is the best option so
15:00:21
even if the system takes 59 cents plus $342 let's round it up to about $5 then
15:00:27
you might pay just one1 extra dollar to go with this option if you get a sell so
15:00:33
because we're profiting a lot and we're marking up our prices by around three times the source price this really
15:00:38
shouldn't be an issue so my personal recommendation what I do in my stores is cheapest with tracking but you can also
15:00:44
go with fastest with tracking if your supplier works well with that just make sure that the difference between
15:00:50
cheapest with tracking and not fastest with tracking is a hefty price on the shipping price so in other words just
15:00:57
make sure that the difference between cheapest and fastest is not so much when it comes to how much it's going to cost you because if for
15:01:04
example you take fastest with tracking but tracking cost $20 and cheapest cost $5 you'll want the system to take the $5
15:01:11
extra into consideration and not the 20 cuz then your selling price is also going to be relatively high and in such a case where there's such a big
15:01:17
difference between cheapest and fastest you're going to go with the cheapest one anyway as long as it has tracking so that's my personal recommendation next
15:01:24
we've got the advanced Lister setting so that is everything that we have here so first of all allow duplicates this means
15:01:29
that if you already have this product in your store and now you're trying to add another product remember that we're in the Lister so these are the options for
15:01:36
every time we list every time we import every time we add a new product so if we allow duplicates this means that if you
15:01:42
already have that product on your store and you're trying to add it again cuz you just didn't notice that you already have it then here the system is going to
15:01:49
stop you and say hey you know you already have this product on your store are you sure that you want to add it right so if you tick in allow duplicates
15:01:55
it's going to allow you to add duplicate items to your store my personal preference is not to have that there's no reason to sell duplicate items in
15:02:02
your store next allow outof stock variations this means that if you have it ticked in and you're trying to add a
15:02:08
product and it has variations in it like the ones that you saw in my store so if some of those variations are out of
15:02:13
stock I still want to add them anyway because when the variation comes back to stock even while I'm away from my
15:02:19
computer it's going to go back in stock on my website as well so my stock is according to my supplier stock so I
15:02:24
might as well add the out of stock variations because sooner or later they're probably going to come back to stock and then will automatically go
15:02:30
back on stock on my store as well then we've got capitalized title this does not have to be important because anyway
15:02:35
we're going to regenerate our titles we're not you leaving the same titles that we're getting from our suppliers so you can have that on or off doesn't
15:02:41
really matter autofill brand means that in many cases your listing a product and there's a brand attached to it whether
15:02:47
it's a super unknown brand which in most cases that's what it's going to be do you want that brand to also show up on
15:02:53
your store in the item specifications or anywhere in the description so if you add autofield brand then in the item
15:02:59
specification of the brand it's going to add that Brand's name I would leave this off there's no reason to add those brand
15:03:04
names then you've got split variants into products so split variance into products means that if I add this
15:03:10
product to my store and it's got variance all right it's got all these variations then it's not going to add
15:03:16
them as variations each variation is going to be added as a standalone
15:03:21
product on my store okay so that means that I'm going to have a white black product I'm going to have a blue yellow
15:03:27
product I'm going to have a rose red yellow stand up Lo product and they're all going to be their own product not
15:03:32
one product with multiple variations but multiple products each in their own variation so just one variation multiple
15:03:38
products so again it depends on your store it depends what you want to do but that is what this option means I'm leaving it off because I do like adding
15:03:44
variations and remember this tip that I gave you that you can add multiple variations from different suppliers and
15:03:50
also from different regions so this really gives you the opportunity and the ability to create a product page that
15:03:56
simply no other drop shipper has because you're creating a unique product page with variations that simply nobody has
15:04:03
all right next in the advanced list or settings is ADD categories to tags so this simply means you know how you got
15:04:08
the tags when you're adding products there's uh the product tags we going to go over all of that and what you can do with it when we get to the uh product
15:04:15
section but this simply means that every time you add a product and it's related to some categories right like dog toys
15:04:23
pets and all that so the categories will be added to the tags of the product which I think is a good idea to have so
15:04:29
I'm leav that on then we've got upload variations so of course I want to go with variations so I'm going with this
15:04:34
option next we've got apply Watermark so if you're adding your own images or if you want to take the supplier's images
15:04:40
and add your own watermarks to them then you can do that by clicking in apply Watermark now later on the settings page
15:04:46
I'm going to show you where you can add that Watermark it's right here in the store settings section but if you want to do that you can go ahead I'm leaving
15:04:52
that option off then you've got duplicate main image up to 12 personally I'm not using this because I'm also
15:04:58
adding my own images if I'm ordering the product to my house and if not then I'm just leaving it as is I'm just removing
15:05:03
the really badl looking images but if you only have one image and you really want to fill up your store with lots of images then it'll just take the main
15:05:09
image and it'll duplicate it up to 12 personally I don't really use it but you can if you see the need to then we've
15:05:15
got allow Vero blocked keywords now what this means is eBay has a database of
15:05:20
Vero Vero stands for verified right owners program and what this is is it's a huge database of branded products that
15:05:29
do not want anyone to resell their products now in the Drop Shipping World you've got tens of millions of products
15:05:34
that you can resell easily with people who are looking for drop shippers to sell their products but in some cases
15:05:39
there are some brands that don't want people reselling their products so they add their names they add their
15:05:45
businesses to the eBay Vero database and autods keeps a similar database of these
15:05:50
Brands and this database is updating all the time so it doesn't matter if you're selling on Shopify eBay Tik Tok shop
15:05:56
Facebook Marketplace Amazon or anywhere else this rule can apply to all you want to keep your store safe and you don't
15:06:02
want to start selling products that you cannot really resell so in order to do that you want to leave this part off do
15:06:08
not allow Vero and blocked keywords we'll also go over block keyword soon this is another option that we can set
15:06:15
configure here in the settings that's when we get here to the keyword section but that is what block keywords means so
15:06:21
in this case I'm not going to allow Vero I'm not going to allow block keywords I want those items out of my store then
15:06:26
we've got price and stock monitoring settings so this we always want to have it on no reason to keep it off unless
15:06:32
you're selling a product that you know will never go out of stock or the price will never change in this case I always keep it on what this means is every time
15:06:39
you add a product from this supplier then you will have price and stock monitoring this means that if I list a
15:06:45
product and the price was $2.50 and tomorrow the supplier raised the product to $10 even though I'm
15:06:51
selling it for $10 so now I'm not going to make any money I might even lose some money so I don't want that to happen if
15:06:57
the supplier raises my price I want my price price to raise as well and autods will do that as long as we've got price
15:07:03
monitoring on so whatever profit percentage we decide that we want like okay I want to make 60% profit I'll
15:07:09
always maintain my 60% profit no matter what happens to the price here and same thing for the stock status so if the
15:07:16
supplier here goes out of stock then it's also going to go out of stock on my store as well so I will not be selling products that are out of so I will not
15:07:22
be selling products that are out of stock and I will not lose money on products if the price changed so that is
15:07:28
it when it comes to the advanc list settings then we've got the AI optimization settings so remember how we talked about having an AI balance so you
15:07:34
can always optimize your titles and descriptions really easily really fast by the system and that is what I did with all of the products that I added
15:07:41
here I Bal grabbed them from the products page and I did a full AI rewrite on the titles and descriptions so here you can do that automatically so
15:07:47
this means that you don't even need to do it when it gets to the drafts page this will happen even before it gets to the drafts page because we're still in
15:07:53
the Lister setting so every time we list the next products from the supplier to this store then they're automatically
15:08:00
going to get AI title optimization and AI description optimization if of course
15:08:05
we have these settings toggled on and here you're going to choose what you want the tone to be the temperature and
15:08:11
same thing for the description so we already did that when we imported the products only we did it when it got to the drafts page because we didn't have
15:08:18
these on so that is the AI optimization settings then you've got the default item specifics so if you know that
15:08:23
you're going to add products and they're all going to have the same item specifics then you can just add them as
15:08:29
the default item specifics here and that way you won't need to add it later when it's in the drafts or in the products
15:08:34
page so for example if you know that you're only going to be listing um let's say dog hats then here under the name
15:08:41
you can write type like product type is dog hat right but we're not doing that
15:08:47
so I'm not going to leave that on but that is what this section controls so that is it for the Lister settings and
15:08:53
now if we save it then again every time we list the product now from the supplier that we selected to the selling
15:08:58
channel that we select Ed then these options these settings these configurations are going to occur now
15:09:03
let's move over to the pricing tab so this is how the system will price your
15:09:08
products and of course this is a very important thing to do you can always do it later when you get to the drafts or product section but mainly it's best to
15:09:15
pre-configure all of these settings so that when you list a product and it goes to your drafts page it's already got the
15:09:20
AI title already got the AI description and it already has the rest of the options that we added here price
15:09:26
monitoring stock monitoring variations and everything else else so now let's also price our products automatically so
15:09:32
we won't have to do it every time we add a product so here you also have an example of okay if the product costs
15:09:38
$100 so if the source price is $100 this is just an example then here is how much
15:09:44
you need to price it in order to keep these settings these pricing settings that you have so let's take it from the
15:09:49
top first is fees how much fees are you paying for your products so here for example I know that Shopify takes around
15:09:55
2.5% transaction fee plus another 1.5 5% International fee so it's around 4 to 5%
15:10:03
something like that so I would keep it around 5% and you can always check that by going to an order that you have and
15:10:10
seeing exactly how much fees they took from you for example the first product that sold from running the Tik Tok ads
15:10:15
the alert Guard Pro sold two units $76 or $75.95 but that's not what I'm going to
15:10:21
get from my Shopify payout if you open up your order details and you scroll down you'll be able to see exactly how
15:10:27
much you're going to get and you can see that Shopify wrote right here that $72.99 was added to your October 22nd
15:10:34
payout so I didn't get the whole $ 7594 they took about $3 to themselves so that
15:10:40
is that few percentage that they're taking and that is why I want to add that 5% to my fees so I'm paying around
15:10:45
5% fees and you're not going to get it exactly on the dollar and on the Cent that is why we're pricing our products
15:10:51
high so that we're always leaving room for profit next is the fee amount in dollars so we know that fees amount in
15:10:56
percentages is around 5% but is there a fixed amount that's being shaved off on every transaction then you would add it
15:11:02
here now you're saying okay these are the fees that I'm paying but how much do you want to profit okay after paying
15:11:08
these fees what is the profit that you're looking for so I would go for no less than 60% and this is what I do on
15:11:15
all of my stores no matter what selling Channel I'm selling on the minimum is 60% additional profit and there's going
15:11:20
to be a lot more optimization to do along the way and I'm going to show you that when we get to the next column the automations and this way you're going to
15:11:26
find a better sweet spot on how to price your products and and then you've got the additional profit in dollar fixed
15:11:32
price so okay you want a profit 60 cents plus $5 plus $1 usually I leave this um
15:11:37
off because I just profit in percentages that is fine for me then you've got default automation I can't choose that
15:11:43
yet because that's in the next tab so I'll go over it when we reach that so after we do it in the next column you can always come back here and choose the
15:11:50
automation that you set and then you've got minimum profit per product so here you're telling the system no matter what
15:11:56
settings I choose over here this is the minimum profit that I want so let's say that all of these settings that I
15:12:01
configured here don't even bring me to $5 profit then I would say Okay I want to make at least $5 minimum profit per
15:12:08
product so that is what the system is going to price according to that minimum profit per product now we've got Dynamic
15:12:14
profit so Dynamic profit means if you have a product that costs anywhere between zero to let's say $10 then you
15:12:21
want to make more than 60% profit cuz these numbers are really low so you want to make 100% profit plus a fixed price
15:12:28
profit Prof it if you want to add that and next you're saying okay if I list a product between $10 to $20 so any item
15:12:37
that LS between $10 to $20 I want to make 60% or let's say 70% profit okay and then every product that I add from
15:12:43
20 all the way up to $99,999 I want to maintain my 60% profit range and that's
15:12:49
simply because the cheap products are not very profitable so you do want to make a little bit more profit in them in order to be profitable like the more
15:12:56
expensive products because we are profiting in percentages then you've got the additional pricing settings so this is the compare price
15:13:03
and set price and value which you should already be aware of because I implemented these in this video earlier
15:13:09
when I was pricing the products but of course I wasn't doing it from the settings I was doing it when it was in the draft section of my store so here
15:13:15
we're going to do the compare price automatically so every time we list products are already going to have this
15:13:21
okay so in other words every product that I add I want the system to shave off 40% so it's not going to remove 40 %
15:13:30
right or 40 fixed price dollars whatever you choose here it's going to first raise the price then it's going to do
15:13:36
the price slash and bring it back down to your desired profit settings so it's always nice to have that remember that
15:13:43
we added that as well let's go to our store really quick and guys do you miss a store already how nice we made it how
15:13:49
we filled it up with categories how great it looks the menus the banners the logos the pages and everything all right
15:13:55
so let's get back to it so let's click on one of the products and here's all the nice stuff that we added sticky ad
15:14:00
two cards live chat frequently bought together but okay back to the issue at hand so this is the Price Slasher I want
15:14:06
to sell this product at $38 but I did add the price slash so it's going to increase the price slash it and bring it
15:14:12
back down to your desired price to your desired profit settings so I always recommend adding this CU it just looks
15:14:18
good to see a product on sale and you've also got the set price in value which as you know will round up your sents to
15:14:24
whatever you want it to be I like the way that 97 looks so that is what I'm going to do on all of my products so
15:14:30
97 and include the shipping price in my opinion is very important to have what this means is even if you are paying for
15:14:37
shipping so for example you chose a product here that has a shipping price all right like let's say this example
15:14:43
right here okay so here you've got a lot of shipping prices 54 and you've already got tracking available right here $2.65
15:14:49
with faster shipping in any case here you have all kinds of prices for shipping so this means that you're not going to pay a $145 right you're going
15:14:56
to pay one of $145 plus one of these prices so what include shipping price
15:15:01
does is it will take the source Price Right $145 and it will take the shipping price
15:15:08
let's say 93 okay so let's say it's going to come out to $22.50 so the autods system is going to
15:15:14
take into consideration that this product does not cost $145 plus $1 shipping it's simply going
15:15:21
to see this product at a source price of $22.50 and that way we are going to make
15:15:28
our extra 100% profit or whatever profit margin we chose we're going to maintain
15:15:33
that profit on the source price of 250 and this way we can always offer free shipping to our buyers because we are
15:15:40
taking into consideration the shipping price inside our source price so we are not going to charge our customers for
15:15:46
shipping even though we are paying for shipping we're taking that into consideration and we're still making our desired profit margin so we are going to
15:15:52
leave include shipping price on that is my personal and professional recommendation so always remember to
15:15:58
save just in case even though you can always save it later but I always like to save before I move on to the next tabs and
15:16:05
now let's move over from pricing to orders so remember that we're still under supplier settings and now I'm setting what happens every time I get an
15:16:12
order from a product that I added from AliExpress to Prime jungle now remember
15:16:18
that all of these changes that we're making it's only going to happen you see where it says down here changes will only be applied for the new products so
15:16:26
if you already have products in your store these settings that you're configuring now is not going to apply on onto them so that is why I always
15:16:32
recommend to take care of your settings as soon as possible so that it will take you less time to optimize your products
15:16:38
later on okay so next in the order section now we've already seen this when I was setting up my automatic orders to
15:16:44
automatically process the orders that I got on my store but now let's dive a little bit deeper into each setting here
15:16:49
so the first setting is process orders using the fulfilled by autods service you already have an idea of what
15:16:55
fulfilled by autods is because I did use it for the orders that I got here but again what it simply means is I'm going
15:17:00
to get orders but I don't want to fulfill them myself by going to the supplier's website adding the product to
15:17:05
my card and checking out and putting in the customers address and shipping directly to them what I want here is for
15:17:11
the system to Simply process the order for me take care of it for me I don't want to do it ship it to the customer
15:17:16
here take some balance use this balance to process the orders to pay for the orders and that's it leave me alone do
15:17:23
the automation for me so I highly highly recommend using fulfilled by autods it is currently supported by all of these
15:17:28
suppliers that we support that charge a US dollar currency we are working on adding more and soon I will show you
15:17:34
where you can also make feature requests in autods because we always listen and we always work on the next features
15:17:39
according to what you want to see in the system and I already showed you how to opt into the service by going to the
15:17:45
account and billing and adding those options as well but even though I showed it before I'm going to get to that soon
15:17:50
in the setting session so in any case this is going to activate the fulfilled by autods service the only thing that
15:17:55
you'll need on top of that is to of course enable the processor from account and billing and next is automatic orders
15:18:02
so if you have both on then the system is going to use fulfilled by autods using the systems buyer accounts it
15:18:07
doesn't need your buyer accounts doesn't need your payment information on your buyer accounts on your supplier websites so if you're using a AliExpress or
15:18:14
Walmart or Amazon you don't even need to have buyer accounts there the system has its own using fulfilled by autods and it
15:18:20
really is great and wonderful automation to have and you're also going to get tracking information uploaded
15:18:25
automatically as soon as it's available from your supplier so that is also a great thing to have and that is fulfilled by autods now if you have the
15:18:31
second one automatic orders filled in as well then as soon as an order comes in it's not going to be in pending setus
15:18:36
it's going to be sent to Auto order right away but if you only have the first one checked in only fulfilled by autods then the system will still use
15:18:43
fulfilled by autods but the order will come in in pending status so you're going to have to manually go to the orders page and change the status
15:18:49
manually from pending to send to Auto order and then the system will begin the order automation process and you can do
15:18:56
this if of course you want to review your order settings and you can do this of course if you would like to review your order details before sending it out
15:19:02
to your customers automatically but if you only have the second option filled in then what this means is the system
15:19:08
will use the automatic order service but it's not fulfilled by autods it's another automatic order service that is
15:19:14
supported by autods so the system has two automatic order methods the first is fulfilled by autods which you are well
15:19:20
aware of automatic orders does support a bit more suppliers and all of them I
15:19:26
will show you soon when we create the buyer accounts for them here in the settings but what this means is your
15:19:31
orders will still be automated but it will use your buyer accounts instead of autod DS's buyer accounts so you will
15:19:37
still need to have a buyer account with your supplier so for example AliExpress you have your buyer account set up
15:19:43
because you registered to AliExpress and the system is going to log into your AliExpress account to process the order
15:19:48
so that you don't have to do it the system will still do it automatically for you but using your buyer account and not the system's buyer account so here
15:19:55
for automatic orders you you do not need to top up your Auto order balance because it's using whatever balance
15:20:01
you're paying with on your buyer account and the reason that I don't completely recommend this method if you don't have
15:20:06
your supplier supported by fulfilled by autods and you still want to have automatic orders then of course it's the best option but if it's fulfilled by
15:20:12
autods versus automatic orders I definitely go with fulfilled by autods because it's not using your buyer accounts if you don't got a choice but
15:20:19
you still want automation then use automatic orders and so that's the difference between fulfilled by autods
15:20:24
and automatic orders so if you only have automatic orders on then it requires a buy account which I will show you how to
15:20:30
set up soon cuz we're going to get to it or fulfilled by autods if you want to use fulfilled by autods but just have
15:20:35
every order sent out automatically so again having both checked in will prefer to use fulfilled by autods and every
15:20:42
order that comes in will be processed out automatically having only the first one checked in will still use fulfilled
15:20:47
by autods but the order will come in pending status and you will move it to send to Auto order using the fulfilled
15:20:52
by autods service having only the second one ticked in we use the automatic order service using your buyer accounts so
15:21:00
this requires you to have a buyer account here now each order will still cost One auto order credit I showed you
15:21:05
how to top up that in the orders page and we're going to go over it again when we go over all of the features after the settings so in any case no matter what
15:21:12
you choose each order will cost One auto order credit and you do get automatic orders and you will get automatic
15:21:17
tracking information updates on your Shopify store and on your autods account once you have tracking information
15:21:23
available from your supplier so all of that is automated hip shipper is mainly relevant for or uh eBay sellers so it's
15:21:30
not really relevant here it's a third party service that enables uh International orders then you've got
15:21:35
override customers phone number so what this does is every time an order comes in instead of using the customer's phone
15:21:41
number you can block that and just write a whatever phone number and this will override your customer's phone number so
15:21:47
this way some people for example ship their products from retailers like Amazon and they don't want the
15:21:52
customer's phone number to be on the Amazon package so that the customer won't get an SMS that hey your Amazon
15:21:58
deliver is on the way and the customer is like wait I didn't order anything from Amazon I ordered from Shopify so to clear that confusion you can always
15:22:04
override the customer's phone number and you should only do that if you notice that there are any problems with your uh
15:22:10
supplier when you're adding a phone number and your customers don't really like it it depends on which suppliers you're using in in our case AliExpress
15:22:17
doesn't really matter you don't really need to overwrite the phone number so in this case if you're using retailers I would recommend overriding the
15:22:23
customer's phone number but if you're working with private suppliers there's really no reason to do so cuz they're not going to tell the customer hey we're
15:22:29
the supplier and next you've got Mark order as delivered automatically after 30 days you can have this on if you want
15:22:35
especially if you're not working with trackable tracking information so you don't know if it was delivered or not so you just want the system to
15:22:40
automatically mark it as delivered after whatever amount of days you want to set here then you've got set order as
15:22:46
shipped so we only want to set the order as shipped once of course it's actually shipped so that's the option we're going to choose you also have ordered or order
15:22:54
is received as soon as you get an order it can automatically move to shipped or as soon as you process your order it
15:22:59
will automatically move to the ship status this is again a good option if you're not using tracking information
15:23:05
but I always always recommend tracking information so just move it to Shi once it's actually shipped with Tracking
15:23:10
Information Tracking conversion is relevant if you're using Amazon as your supplier and the reason for that is
15:23:17
because sometimes Amazon will give you a TBA tracking number so for example take
15:23:23
a look at this order right here from Amazon so you can see that it was delivered by Amazon and I've got a
15:23:28
tracking ID which is a TBA tracking number now this tracking number is not trackable so in this case if we give the
15:23:35
customer this whole TBA 316 blah blah tracking number they're not going to be able to track it even if they use the
15:23:41
track your order button that we added here on the website this tracking number TBA from Amazon is not trackable
15:23:47
anywhere except for your own personal buyer account whoever purchased the product is the only one who can see the
15:23:53
tracking information so that is not practical and for that we have tracking conversion so here you have a few
15:24:00
different tracking conversion options you can convert all your tracking numbers to Q track so this you can do if
15:24:05
you're working only with Amazon as your supplier and you don't even want to use the major shipping carriers that Amazon
15:24:11
sometimes gives you like USPS UPS FedEx and all of that you just want to convert everything to qra qra also comes with
15:24:18
zip code Master Grade which is good for eBay because it will give you the same item location on the first tracking event as what you have in your listing
15:24:24
anyway not really relevant for Shopify then you've got convert Amazon shipping carrier only to qra so this means that
15:24:30
every time and only when I get a TBA tracking number only then convert it to Q track and by the way qra can be
15:24:36
tracked outside of Amazon so you can track it here by adding it to the track your order on your page and then you'll be able to track it using Q track so
15:24:43
here I'm on Q track's website I'm going to put the qra tracking number and here anyone will be able to use this you the
15:24:50
customer and anyone else so here you can prove using the tracking events that the product was delivered to its address and
15:24:55
you can see it right here so Monday OCT oober 21st the carrier picked up the package and it was delivered on that
15:25:02
same day to the address that you shipped out to so that's why it's important if you're using Amazon as your supplier to
15:25:08
use tracking conversion and my personal recommendation here is to use convert Amazon shipping carrier only to Q track
15:25:14
because if it's not the Amazon shipping carrier you can track it anyway your customer can track it so there's no reason to convert those and that is the
15:25:21
option that I would choose here you've also got blue care Express so convert your tracking numbers from Amazon to uh
15:25:27
Blue Care Express Ultra tracking or only Amazon shipping carrier and you've also got generate UPS FedEx and DHL tracking
15:25:33
number this is also a great option to use but it will convert all of your orders to a UPS FedEx or DHL so if
15:25:39
you're getting one of these tracking numbers from a major shipping carrier anyway then you don't really need to choose these options but just know that
15:25:45
you've got this option as well that will convert all your tracking numbers to trackable UPS FedEx and DHL okay so that
15:25:51
is tracking conversion use it as you see fit next you've got maximum purchase order price so here you can set what you
15:25:58
want the maximum price to be to still be able to fulfill in order automatically
15:26:03
so this means for example okay if the product costs $60 or more then I don't want the automatic order service to uh
15:26:10
process the order I want to come and check out the order and see if I want to process it so the system will not
15:26:16
automatically process an order if it's on your maximum purchase order price or higher and you've also got maximum loss
15:26:22
there's no reason for this to happen but if for any reason you're losing money on an order then you can tell the system okay if I'm losing at least $1 or more
15:26:29
then don't process the order I just want to come and check it out and take action next you've got automatic messages to
15:26:35
customers which is only relevant if you're selling on eBay so then you've got automatic messages to customers so
15:26:41
if you're working with a supplier that has a gifting option so it has an option to Mark the order as a gift Amazon has
15:26:48
this option sometimes AliExpress has this option and other suppliers as well then if they have this option then the
15:26:54
system will process the order automatically and it will also use the gift option and it will write a gift message to the buyer so here you can set
15:27:00
what you want the gift message to be we can click on the pencil icon right here and write what you want the message to have you also have these triggers in
15:27:07
order to add their first name last name the title of the product or the store name so here you can write what you want
15:27:12
to the customer save it make sure that it's toggled on and you'll automatically send them gift messages with their
15:27:18
purchases and you've got general settings very straightforward to the point so the default weight unit you
15:27:24
want it to be in pounds or ounces or kilogram or grams ship to Warehouse here you can choose what is your default
15:27:30
Warehouse that you're shipping to so for example if you're shipping only to the United States and keep it on United States or worldwide keep it on worldwide
15:27:36
then you've got automatic SKU filling now in my case I usually have this off because what the school filling does is
15:27:43
it'll take the same scool from your supplier's website and it'll put the same scool on your website when you're adding this product so this makes it a
15:27:49
little bit easier if someone's trying to snipe your website or like another drop ship or some competitors looking at your website and they're trying to figure out
15:27:54
where you're getting these products from they can just copy the sko and paste it on Google or on their suppliers websites
15:28:00
and probably find it there as well so it'll just make it a little bit harder for the competitors to find out where
15:28:05
we're sourcing our products from if we have this option on off so I'm leaving it off then we've got monitoring so what
15:28:12
is the minimum product quantity that you want to have in stock on your supplier's website so that it will also be on stock
15:28:18
on your website as well so for example if I want the minimum product quantity to be five so this means that if my
15:28:24
supplier has four units or three units anywhere below my minimum product quantity if that's how much they have
15:28:30
left in stock then I don't want to sell it I want it out of stock on my store and the reason that you want to set this is because if your supplier has one left
15:28:37
in stock and you're not processing your orders automatically quickly or anything like that and you get an order and then
15:28:43
your supplier gets an order from someone else and sends it out to that someone else and so by the time you're reaching your supplier they're already out of
15:28:50
stock so you want to have a minimum product qualtity and especially if you're close to big holiday shopping
15:28:55
Seasons like end of the year Q4 Christmas and any other special event that we have during the year you
15:29:01
definitely want to set a minimum product quantity so here I would go around let's say four three five anywhere around that
15:29:08
just to make sure that you'll always be in stock just so that you won't be selling products that suddenly go out of stock on your supplier's website and you
15:29:14
still didn't have enough time to fulfill the order yourself or take it out of stock cuz you don't have stock monitoring for whatever reason then
15:29:21
you've got maximum shipping days so this means okay if my supplier goes above this maximum shipping days then I want
15:29:27
it to go out out of stock on my store and when I say out of stock when the system will take something out of stock
15:29:32
because of a certain setting that you have even if your supplier still has stock then it will go out of stock on
15:29:37
your website but on autods it'll show us on hold I'll show you that when we get to the products page but basically under
15:29:44
the variations you'll see that it's either in stock on hold or out of stock in stock means it's in stock it's live
15:29:50
on your store anyone can buy it it's it's it's also in stock in your supplier store on hold means that it's in stock
15:29:55
on the supplier's website but the system had to take get out of stock on your website because of some setting that you
15:30:01
configured here like one of these options that we're doing here and out of stock means it's out of stock in your suppliers website so of course it's out
15:30:07
of stock on your website as well okay so here maximum shipping days if I would set it let's say to 21 so this is about
15:30:13
3 weeks this means that if I have a product on my store that takes more than 3 weeks to ship out then I want it out
15:30:19
of stock if it takes my supplier 22 days 20 23 days anything above that then I want it out of stock on my website so
15:30:26
out of stock physically but unhold uh virtually on my store okay so that is the maximum shipping days and that
15:30:33
concludes the supplier settings now let's move over to automations this is a pricing automation strategy let me show
15:30:39
you exactly what this does but basically this will find The Sweet Spot and you'll be able to price your products exactly
15:30:46
on the point where they are making the most amount of sales at the highest price so that you can maintain the
15:30:52
highest profit while the product is making consistent sales so let me show you exactly what that means and how that
15:30:57
works if I click here on ADD automation I will set a new pricing strategy so let's call this one prime jungle pricing
15:31:05
automation okay I talked about this when we were just in the supplier settings okay so here we can first raise price by
15:31:11
sales performance so this means that every time I sell a product on on my Shopify store every time I sell a
15:31:18
product more than let's say three times per 7 days so if I sell the product more
15:31:24
than three times a week then I want you to raise the product price by a certain
15:31:29
percentage so let's say by 5% up to a limit of let's say 30% cuz I don't want
15:31:34
to go way too high and also you can increase the product price by a set dollar fixed amount okay so if I sell a
15:31:41
product more than three times a week then raise the price by 5% up to a limit of 30% plus anything else that you added
15:31:48
here and next so now we're going to set the pricing strategy to decrease the price if the product doesn't sell okay
15:31:54
so the opposite of what we just did so now when the the number of sells is less
15:31:59
than let's say two per 7 days so this means again if I'm selling less than two
15:32:05
units per week or let's even make it more drastical if I'm selling less than
15:32:11
one unit per week so if the product went for one week without getting any sales
15:32:16
then I want you to automatically decrease the price of the product okay let's say by uh 7% down to a limit of
15:32:24
21% because below that I'll just be on my break even and I don't want to sell anything at Cost okay and you can also
15:32:30
do the same thing on a fixed dollar amount okay usually I'm working with percentages but you can also work with a fixed dollar amounts so again what this
15:32:36
means is okay the product is selling well we're going to increase the price still selling continue to increase still
15:32:41
selling continue to increase okay up to a certain limit because if you don't want to go too high and now it's making
15:32:47
sells but now let's say for example the price is too high and now no one's buying it anymore now the system is going to start decreasing the price
15:32:54
decrease decrease decrease until it starts making sales again oh it's sold making more than two per week going to
15:32:59
go up again and this way it's going to find that sweet spot where as I mentioned it's going to keep making
15:33:04
consistent sales at the highest price point so that we can make the most amount of profit while always continuing
15:33:09
to rake in sales okay so we're going to click on next and now it's saying okay I got your price rules when to increase
15:33:15
when to decrease the price what products do you want to add this rule to and here we've got the products that we added to
15:33:20
Prime jungle with the nice AI titles and all of the variations so I could just say Okay do this for all of the products
15:33:27
on my store so I clicked here it selected only the first 40 products that we saw here but you can click here to
15:33:32
select all 62 products that we added to Prime jungle and go ahead and click on finish now the pricing automation
15:33:38
setting is going to be applied to all of those products so you can see that I've got this toggled on this is the prime
15:33:44
jungle pricing Automation and right now it's adding it to all of those products in all of their variations so that we
15:33:51
will find The Sweet Spot for those products so now if we just go really quickly back to supplier settings
15:33:56
remember that we had the option here to choose a pricing automation under the pricing tab so here under pricing under
15:34:03
automation we can now choose Prime jungle pricing Automation and so now every time I list a new product it's
15:34:09
going to automatically have the pricing automation settings that we just said for Prime jungle so that is the pricing
15:34:15
automation feature templates is more relevant for those who have eBay stores but this is a really nice feature that
15:34:21
you're getting for free on autods you can just have all of these templates any one of these templates and just choose them and you'll have a template on
15:34:27
Shopify we're using free themes anyway so we already have it but just so you know what that is Now keywords this is
15:34:33
where you can block list items from either having a certain word being written in the titles or descriptions or
15:34:40
completely block them from being imported added to your store because they have such a keyword so let me show
15:34:46
you exactly what that means you can click here on ADD keywords and I'm saying okay every time these words come
15:34:51
up like let's say patented or patent right because it's got a patent on it and we can't really sell it even though
15:34:57
the system has has the Vero uh blocker the database we always want to stay extra protected um let's say it has uh
15:35:04
it says contact us with like some phone number or something I don't want that because I don't want them to contact
15:35:09
them I want them to contact me um let's say it has um Amazon in the description
15:35:15
because I don't know we added a product from Amazon and it says Amazon somewhere in the description I don't want my my customer to know that so I don't want
15:35:21
that there as well and uh anything else any other keyword that you do not like to have in your listings so you can just
15:35:26
edit here in the keywords list and now you're saying okay if this keyword appears in the product's title then
15:35:32
either do nothing don't upload the product or just delete that text from the product and same thing in the
15:35:38
description if the keyword is in the description then do nothing don't upload it or don't upload just that text same
15:35:43
thing for if the keyword appears in the products manufacturer you do not want to sell a product from a certain manufacturer but you're adding products
15:35:48
in bulk so you're not going through all of them one by one so here you can choose okay if it's got this manufacturer inside of the keyword that
15:35:54
I added here then either do nothing or don't upload the product and that is what the keyword blocker will do next
15:36:00
we've got plans and add-ons so we've pretty much seen this but plans and add-ons is where you're going to add your selling channels so if you want to
15:36:07
sell on Shopify you're going to add a Shopify plan and don't worry about this price this is not the price that you are
15:36:13
going to pay you're going to pay according to our basic Shopify plans when you're getting started you're going to start with the basic or starter plans
15:36:19
and you're slowly going to start to move up and scale up this plan right here is for selling 30,000 products on your
15:36:25
store so of course it's not the first plan that you're going to go with okay so just to not scare you off so quick your first plan starts at $20 your next
15:36:31
plan is at $30 and this is for listing 200 or 500 products on on a Shopify and this is if you want to add a Shopify
15:36:37
store if you want to add for example an eBay store then you've got the pricing plans here and so forth same thing for
15:36:43
every other selling channel so the prices are dynamic they could change from time to time by the time I'm recording this video to the time that
15:36:48
you're watching it in any case you are going to start only for $1 for your first 14 days so do not forget that
15:36:55
you're going to definitely try before you buy and then I would recommend starting with a starter 500 $30 per
15:37:00
month is nothing compared to the sales and profits that you will be raking in once you have the set tools knowledge
15:37:05
and experience that I am passing on to you and with that you're going to get all of the automation settings and the
15:37:10
ability to list 500 products which is a lot especially when those products start to sell so in any case that is the plans
15:37:17
and add-ons so you're going to choose a plan when you register for autods and the add-ons I definitely recommend the
15:37:22
product finding Hub because this is going to give you access to the handpicked products the trending products and the adspy tool as I showed
15:37:29
you and the orders processor to enable automatic orders and you've got more add-ons like our mentorship program and
15:37:35
VA users if you want to enable virtual assistance to help you automate your store even more I'm going to get to that
15:37:41
when we get to the users right here but basically you can hire a virtual assistant and you can give them access
15:37:46
to certain parts of your store and slowly delegate more and more privileges to them as you guys start to build your
15:37:52
trust and relationship together so you can also have VA accounts and this of course means that you don't have to give
15:37:57
someone full access to your autods account but just certain parts and as I mentioned slowly give them more as you
15:38:03
build your trust then we've got account and billing so here you're going to add your payment information to auts to pay
15:38:09
for the plans and so forth to pay for the plans and add-ons and here you are going to see your billing history so
15:38:15
every time you paid how much you paid what for it's all going to be written here in account and billing and now
15:38:20
you've got your users so users is again for the virtual assistants here let's say I hired a virtual assistant and I
15:38:27
want to give them access to certain parts of my store so I'm going to click here on add user okay I'm going to give them a name so let's say this person's
15:38:34
name is Johnny okay I'm going to write uh John's email address so it's John ads.com there is no such person so don't
15:38:41
worry about it you don't start sending them emails you you won't nobody is going to read it and here you're going to set a password okay for John E access
15:38:48
and here you can give them access to either all of your stores or a selected store so here I want to give them only
15:38:54
access to Prime jungle here's all the stores that I have connected to this autod account yes you can have multiple
15:38:59
stores multiple regions multiple selling channels all under the same autods account and this way you'll have a full
15:39:05
business overview you can go to the products page to the orders page to the dashboard everything else and you'll see
15:39:10
what's going on in all of those stores under one screen which I think is absolutely amazing or you can just select specific stores what you want to
15:39:17
see but the important note here is that you can add multiple selling channels multiple stores from multiple regions
15:39:23
all to the same autods account so right now I'm creating a VA or a virtual assistant account on autods for my
15:39:29
virtual assistant Johnny and I want to give him access only to Prime jungle and here are the Privileges that I want to
15:39:35
give him so first I want to give him access to see my dashboard and then I want to give him access to view and edit
15:39:41
my active products and this will also open up ending the products listing new products and importing untracked
15:39:46
listings I'll go over that soon then you can also give the ability to view edit and delete drafts and view edit your
15:39:52
orders handle customer messages and cases this is only relevant to eBay if view import untrack listings list new
15:39:59
products end active products or untrack products and View and edit your settings so give them access to whatever you want
15:40:05
in the beginning I would definitely take it slow get to know them so for example I can let them View and edit my active
15:40:11
products I'd say okay go to Every product and optimize it make it even better even though we pretty much used AI for this but this is just one example
15:40:18
let's give them the option to list new products okay I want to test their product research capabilities and see
15:40:23
what products they're able to come up with and add to my store and do all of the optimiz ation but I don't want to
15:40:28
give them access to end my active products or delete products from my store at least not just yet I want to make sure that they know what they're
15:40:34
doing and that they don't accidentally I don't know delete all the products from my store and then I won't be selling anything okay so this is how you're
15:40:39
going to give them access and what to and when you're done you're going to click on add user and I guess I already
15:40:45
used John and so here we have Johnny now added as a virtual assistant so now we're going to contact Johnny and be
15:40:52
like hey I created your autods account go to autod s.com sign in with this
15:40:57
email and with password so these are your credentials log in and start working on my business next we've got
15:41:03
buyer accounts so this is for the automatic orders remember how I mentioned that there's fulfilled by autods and there's automatic orders
15:41:09
there are two different things and so automatic orders is actually using our buyer accounts so this is where you're
15:41:14
going to add those buyer accounts so that the system can use it to process your orders automatically but again
15:41:19
using your buyer accounts so here you're telling the system okay I want to use the automatic order service not
15:41:25
fulfilled by autods but automatic order so here I'm going to click on add account and here this is the supplier
15:41:30
that I want to enable automatic orders with So currently we support AliExpress Home Depot Walmart and Amazon so let's
15:41:35
say I'm going to go with AliExpress then I'm going to click on connect with AliExpress and it's going to connect my
15:41:41
autods account with AliExpress I'm just going to click on authorize and the account will be connected and now I can
15:41:47
start using my automatic order service with AliExpress now other suppliers may not have the direct connection option so
15:41:54
for example I'm going to click on add account but this instead of AliExpress I'm going to go with Amazon so here I
15:42:00
need to write down my Amazon credentials okay what's my email address what is my billing name and phone number zip code
15:42:06
what is the password to my Amazon account and what region I want to automate it from so in this case it's United States okay and you'll also have
15:42:13
to enter the verification code that you're getting from Amazon you can just hover over it click on more info to understand how to get that verification
15:42:20
code very easy simple straightforward process click on next and it will connect to your Amazon account next
15:42:25
you'll also have to set your payment settings here so how do you want to pay for each order after the system logs
15:42:31
into your Amazon account so here you're going to add your credit card I do not recommend going with gift card and in
15:42:37
any case I also don't really recommend processing your orders manually or using your buyer account to process orders
15:42:42
specifically from Amazon because at some point when you have lots of orders and you're processing lots of orders from
15:42:47
one buyer account to multiple addresses they may lock your account and you won't be able to access it again and purchase
15:42:54
more okay so nobody really wants that if you're only processing a few Ord nothing's really going to happen but once you really start to scale up this
15:43:00
is going to be a little bit problematic so just take that as a little tip from me and for that you have the solution of
15:43:05
fulfilled by autods you don't need to have your buyer accounts you don't need to worry about autod DS's buyer accounts because all of that is being automated
15:43:11
for you and you won't really have this worry but this is how you're going to get that set up so here you're going to add your payment methods and the system
15:43:17
will log into your Amazon account information that you added here using the payment methods that you added here
15:43:23
and you can set extra settings here for that buyer account and so what Max pending orders means and this was especially created as a defensive
15:43:29
mechanism for your Amazon buyer account to try to avoid it getting locked as much as possible so this is how many
15:43:35
orders you want to have unordered status before the system can process new orders that come in in pending from Amazon and
15:43:41
this is simply because you want to have them shipped out before processing new orders and the reason why is because
15:43:47
let's say I got 10 orders on my Amazon buyer account and they're all in ordered status none of them have shipped out yet
15:43:53
and now I process 10 more orders from my Amazon account and now I've got 20 processed orders on my Amazon account
15:43:59
and Amazon's like whoa what's this lock this account now the account is locked and I don't know what's going on with my
15:44:04
orders are they going to be shipped were they cancelled and now I've got 20 orders and I have no idea what's going on with them and this is big big trouble
15:44:11
so here you're telling the system okay I want the maximum pending orders for example to be three so as long as I've
15:44:16
got three orders on ordered status and they haven't shipped out yet and I've got new orders in pending don't process
15:44:22
the pending orders until those Max three pending orders that are in order status
15:44:27
have moved to shipped once they move to shipped you can process new orders so how many orders do you want in ordered
15:44:33
status what is the maximum orders that you want so let's say five maximum orders that are in ordered status that
15:44:38
haven't shipped out yet if I have that do not process new orders once those five orders are shipped shipped shipped
15:44:44
then process another order another order another order and so forth daily orders price limit you can set that if you want
15:44:51
to limit the amount of orders that the system uses from your buy account per day so for example you don't want to process more than five orders on this
15:44:58
buyer account per day because you want to save it from being locked you want to protect it so you would say that the daily orders price limit is five and
15:45:04
every time we reach five orders from this buyer account per day the system will wait to the next day to process the
15:45:10
next orders that come after that then you've got order scan so you can enable this if you want the system to scan your
15:45:17
Amazon account your buyer account that you added here to see if there's any orders on your Amazon account that don't exist on autods just so that autods
15:45:24
won't try to process an order that you may have already processed process manually so this will simply protect you from having duplicate orders okay once
15:45:30
we're done here adding the buyer account we're going to click on ADD and that buyer account will be added and you can enable that by again going back to your
15:45:37
supplier settings then going to the order settings this time we're on Amazon because we added an Amazon buy account
15:45:43
and we're going to enable automatic orders not fulfilled by autods because we just added a buyer account and this
15:45:49
is the option that we want to go with again my recommendation is to use fulfill by autods because once again your accounts will never get locked you
15:45:55
don't need to worry about using your own buyer accounts you don't need to have multiple buyer Accounts at multiple suppliers websites and you'll simply be
15:46:00
using autod DS's buyer accounts much much easier less of a headache but if you don't have that option go with
15:46:06
automatic orders and if you don't have or don't want that option for some reason then just process the orders manually from your suppliers websites
15:46:12
but at scale this is definitely going to be an issue and it will limit you from growth all right so that is the buyer
15:46:18
accounts next we've got notifications so this one is pretty much straightforward this is telling the system I want you to
15:46:23
send me an email notification every time one of these events occur if an order fail to process you're going to toggle
15:46:29
that on once I have a tracking number update so tracking information is available from my supplier I want you to
15:46:35
send me an email about that every time an order successfully gets sent out or
15:46:40
gets processed by the system every time there's a stock monitoring update so if an item goes out of stock or back into
15:46:47
stock and the same thing for Price monitoring updates then you're going to select how often you want to get these
15:46:52
updates every day every week or every month and to what email address would you like to get these updates so that is
15:46:59
what the notifications column is responsible for and last but not least you've got Store settings so here you've
15:47:05
got additional settings like if you need to renew your token for some reason if there's some sync problem and support told you to renew your token you can do
15:47:12
it from here as well and here's where you can also set a store Watermark so I mentioned that before when we were in
15:47:18
the supplier settings and it was the Lister settings if I'm not mistaken it was right here under the advanced list
15:47:24
settings apply Watermark so if you have this enabled then of course you're going to have to add the watermark from here
15:47:30
so it'll know what Watermark to grab and it'll add that to the products that you're adding on your store so you're
15:47:35
going to click on ADD Watermark and here you can click on new Watermark give it a name and select a file from your
15:47:42
computer so click on browse get to your watermark select it and click on upload and then that will be used next you've
15:47:49
got the resin store so this is kind of similar to renew token it just kind of resyncs the store and checks for new
15:47:54
updates you don't really need to activate resync store or renew token token again unless there's some issue and you're getting help from support and
15:48:00
they ask you to take one of these actions and there you have additional options to manage your domain if you need to do so and here you've got
15:48:07
branding settings so remember how when I showed you the marketplace and that many of our private suppliers also support
15:48:13
customizable branding so every time you sell a product from a private supplier that supports customizable branding
15:48:19
because it says so in the listing then your product will get sent out with your logo next to it and that logo will be
15:48:25
taken from here so that image that text that graphic card whatever is going to be taken from from whatever image you
15:48:31
choose to upload so you can click here to open up your browser select your logo and it will upload here so here I
15:48:37
uploaded an autods logo so this means that every time I sell a product from the autods marketplace from a private
15:48:43
supplier that supports customizable branding it will get sent out with this logo that I have here so that is a great
15:48:48
great option and I highly recommend using this because one working with private suppliers as a drop shipper is
15:48:54
simply a treat you get great product you get great prices you get to build a relationship with your private supplier
15:49:00
get to know them and grow your businesses together great shipping great products great prices great insights and
15:49:07
these people are hungry to work with you hungry to make money with you and you've got The Branding options which is even
15:49:12
better because now your customer is going to notice your brand recognize it remember it and that is how you're slowly going to start building your
15:49:18
brand which is the cherry on the top in all of this and that pretty much concludes everything that we have under
15:49:24
the autods settings be sure to take full advantage of the settings so that when you add products and when you're in the
15:49:30
flow of the dayto day all of your products are completely optimized and you will not have to go inside each
15:49:36
product and edit them one by one with the settings that you want so configure your settings the right way for your
15:49:41
business so that everything will always be optimized and you will save so much time down the road now I think that one
15:49:47
of the most important things here on the product page is to understand how to use these filters up here so you see where
15:49:53
it says add filter of course I'm going to click on it you can search for a specific filter and you can also save your filters whatever you choose to do
15:50:00
and then you'll be able to see it here under saved filters okay but for now let's try to understand what this means so let's say you've got 100 products
15:50:07
here or a thousand or tens of thousands of products Here and Now you kind of want to start seeing like what's going
15:50:12
on with them analyze them remove the slow movers keep the best ones and add more of the ones that are similar so in
15:50:18
order to do all of this optimization the filter here is going to help you out cuz it's not going to be very fun to just
15:50:24
see thousands of products here and trying to understand what to do with them so we're going to click here on ADD filters and here you can filter through
15:50:31
your products using various options for example I only want to see products that
15:50:37
have a certain sell Item ID or on a specific selling site so for example I
15:50:43
only want to see products that I have on Shopify or on Facebook or on Tik Tok so whatever selling Channel you want to use
15:50:49
or you can say I only want to see products that are coming from a certain supplier or that are coming from a
15:50:54
certain region or that have specific tags in them so for example tags is a good option I'm going to choose that and
15:51:00
I'm going to say okay I want to see on my store or on all of my stores put together or whatever stores I chose here
15:51:07
on the store selector on the left side and in the products page I want to see all of the ones that are connected that
15:51:14
are in the kitchen and Home Appliances tag okay so I will choose that tag you can also choose multiple tags and then
15:51:21
when you're done you're going to click on done and now you're going to see all the products under that tag only here I don't have any products products under
15:51:26
that tag so let's just find a better example so because I have a whole bunch of tags then I'm going to have to do a
15:51:32
manual search okay so for example I'm going to search for pets okay so the
15:51:37
pets tag and I'm going to click on done then it's going to show me all the products that are under the pets tag so this way I'll be able to analyze a
15:51:44
certain category or a certain tag under my store here I can be like okay this Cactus inspired pet bed right here
15:51:51
doesn't have any stock and I can see that it's been out of stock for zero days so it just went out of stock today
15:51:56
so we can still give it some more time for the supplier to replenish the stock but you can also see that if for example
15:52:01
it's got a lot of outut of stock days like the previous example where I removed one of those products then you're going to remove these products as
15:52:07
well so this is how you can kind of Niche down on a certain tag or see how a certain category is selling under your
15:52:13
products you can also do the same filter for the title so let's say I only want a title I only want to see products that
15:52:20
have something in the title like for example I wanted to contain a certain
15:52:25
word like for example uh compact so I want to see everything that's compact
15:52:31
that has compact in the title and here I can see a whole bunch of products that I have compact in the title okay so same
15:52:37
thing for the rest you can do the same thing for the brand uh if you added a personal internal note so you can only
15:52:42
filter products where you added notes on them sell price Buy price so for example okay let's see Buy price and I only want
15:52:49
to see all of the products that costs more than $50 okay to purchase I'm not
15:52:55
sure if I have any let's see yeah we do have some really expensive products here so we do see that we have some
15:53:02
variations on this portable USB rechargeable product so there's a total of three variations here they're all in
15:53:08
stock and they do have a price range between 26 to $54 and that is why
15:53:14
because of the $54 variation that is why it's showing up here on buy prices that are over $50 then we've got this wine
15:53:21
bottle holder right here cost $69 this vlogging camera that cost $7 $6
15:53:27
and so forth another filter that we can do is profit percentages quantities so I
15:53:32
only want to see let's say products that are making less than $5 in profit okay
15:53:38
let's up their profits let's see why they're not profiting so much like all of these products over here and that's
15:53:43
simply because we didn't optimize their pricing and we definitely didn't do it in these settings before we listed these
15:53:49
products as I showed you how to do so in this case what I would do is I would select all these products then I'm going
15:53:54
to click on select all 25 products where all 25 of these are making us less than $5 in profit then I can do a bulk edit
15:54:02
and say Okay add item to edit is the total profit so here on these products
15:54:08
because the profit is so low instead of making 60% profit let's make it 100%
15:54:13
profit okay and this way it's going to increase the pricing of these products and we will not make such low profits
15:54:20
and you can see that the bulk changes are being done right now really as we speak and now it's looking better
15:54:25
because a product that cost $1 it's not going to be sold for like $16 it's going to be sold for $24 now and we can
15:54:32
already see that it's going to bring us $11 in profit instead of those $5 $4
15:54:38
whatever it was so if I refresh this page we should already see these changes as well okay so now we're not making
15:54:45
small profits anymore there are no products that make only $5 in profit now in $18 product is going to be sold for
15:54:51
$38 making us around $18 in profit now of course do your due diligence check your pricing and make sure that your
15:54:58
products are priced correctly but the really cheap products that cost anywhere up to let's say $10 in Source price you
15:55:04
should not be selling them for 50 60% profit that's not going to put a lot of profit in your pocket we are here to
15:55:09
make greater profits and we're only going to do that if we up our prices now of course there's a limit to everything you cannot sell a product for thousands
15:55:16
and thousands of dollars because obviously no one's going to buy it but when it comes to drop shipping and finding these unique products and you
15:55:23
Market it at a certain angle you're definitely going to make at least 60% in your profit and that is how I always
15:55:30
price my products at least 60% profit or at least 2.5 to three times the source
15:55:35
price as we talked about okay so that is how we make those block changes as well next filter that we can do here so we
15:55:41
saw selling prices buying prices uh profits quantities inventory status so here for example okay I want to see out
15:55:48
of all the thousands of products that I have on my stores I want to see which ones are out of stock okay so I would
15:55:54
choose that one and let's say I ow also want to see the ones that are also on hold so either on hold or out of stock
15:56:00
show me all of those products okay so I'm going to click on done and these are all the products that have variations out of stock or on hold as we can see
15:56:07
right here so here you can see how long they've been out of stock for and decide if you still want to keep them in your stores if not obviously just hover over
15:56:14
them bulk grab and bulk delete okay now you can save these filters as you saw earlier so here I'm going to click on
15:56:20
Save and we going to name this out of stock or on hold okay that's the name of the filter
15:56:26
going to save it and now I'll always be able to choose it so here for example okay let's just uh refresh the products
15:56:33
page okay and here I'm going to click on ADD filter and then saved filters I've got out of stock and on hold and if I
15:56:39
click on that it's going to show me those products of course again okay so that is the inventory status next you
15:56:45
have collections so you can filter by collections by City location that you have inside the product listing uh stock
15:56:51
monitoring price monitoring uh products that have automatic orders products that have Vero violation so you've been
15:56:56
warned that this product has a certain something that raised the red flag or you should that you want to upload it to your store if you chose yes then those
15:57:03
products are going to show up under Vero violation fees that you're paying profit percentages and profit in fixed dollar
15:57:09
amounts the sold count so here for example you can say okay I only want to see products that didn't sell so sold
15:57:16
less than one unit or that have more than three sells because maybe we want
15:57:22
to do further optimization to make them sell even more or that's sold a specific
15:57:27
amount of times or that's sold between a certain range like products that sold between two to four times for example
15:57:34
okay so that's an example of the uh sold count and you also have upload date so products that were uploaded from a
15:57:40
certain point or up to a certain point or between certain points uh sold date out of stock days so products that have
15:57:47
been out of stock for a while uh products that have a monitoring error um that have an on hold reason so they're
15:57:53
on hold for a specific reason or products that had certain supplier changes that happen to them you can
15:57:58
filter those as well so the filters is really important to understand how to work with it and how it can really help
15:58:04
optimize your business when you're optimizing your inventory and when I say inventory of course I mean virtual
15:58:09
inventory you do not pay for this inventory you're only going to pay for those products after you make a sale
15:58:15
that's Drop Shipping but I still like to call it inventory so here is where you can make the optimization of all of that
15:58:20
and you can click on view history here if you want to see all of the changes that happened on this product page that
15:58:27
you did so you're going to see all of that here in the products history okay so here for example for today we can see
15:58:32
that we updated uh 24 or 25 products and if I click on details here we can see
15:58:38
the changes that actually happened so we can see here that the action was set the profit percentage to 100% profit and it
15:58:45
happened to all of these products in bulk okay so the history will show you that history and of course customized display is where you can display the
15:58:51
columns that you want to see here if you want to see this before that column or if you want to disable or enable other
15:58:59
columns and that is a brief overview of the products page which we didn't get to before now the drafts page is almost
15:59:06
similar to the products page only here as you know we kind of started off here where we were optimizing the products so
15:59:11
when you're adding products to autods by default they're going to be added to the draft section of your store now when
15:59:17
you're importing products using any of the methods that I showed you in this video you can also choose if you want the products to import right away to the
15:59:23
products without being optimized in the drafts first but I always recommend optimizing first through the drafts okay
15:59:29
so here for example we've got uh three test products on the draft section of our store and as you guys know you can
15:59:34
click on this quick editor right here to start the editing we've already been through all of this so I'm not going to do it again but you have more
15:59:40
information here like the destination which store this draft is going to go to the supplier that you're uploading it from so this one is from AliExpress this
15:59:46
one is from Amazon this one is from print on demand and here we can make a few changes so bulk edits as you guys
15:59:52
are already used to from the products page you can remove them from the drafts page page import them to the drafts page do a bulk AI rewrite as you have in the
15:59:59
products page as well but it's better to do it in the draft section first and you also have schedule listings so this
16:00:04
gives you the opportunity to not import them to your store now but import them at a later date and time so for example
16:00:11
let's say I finished optimizing these products and now I want to schedule to upload them at a later date and time so
16:00:16
I would choose that later date the time then I will click on schedule okay so here for example let's click on that and
16:00:23
now they're going to be moving to the schedule so from drafts going to move to scheduled and from scheduled they're
16:00:28
going to move to the product section of our store okay so slowly right now it's happening it's finished let's give it a
16:00:33
quick refresh and now we can see that those three drafts are scheduled so I can click here on scheduled and here I
16:00:40
can see the schedule for a few days from now so for the date that I chose I can click on that and that's going to show
16:00:46
me these three scheduled products and from here you can continue to do optimization and whatever is needed to
16:00:51
make sure that these products are super organized super optimized before selling them on our stores and that would
16:00:57
conclude the draft section of our store customer support is more for eBay sellers where they can see all their messages all in one place and kind of
16:01:03
you know interact with their customers and take care of cases and things like that and messages is where we are
16:01:09
messaging private suppliers so if you're in the autods marketplace and you're sending messages to suppliers using the
16:01:16
messaging function so let's again open up the autods suppliers just as a quick example let's say we're taking an
16:01:22
interest in this portable heater right here you can click on this button right here message just supplier and open up a
16:01:29
chat with them and you can see that I have open chats with with other suppliers as well so like this one Hello nice to meet you I would like to start
16:01:35
Drop Shipping your products this is my message to him may I know which shipping carriers you work with and if there are any additional products you haven't
16:01:40
added to autods yet and they said we always use USPS all our items are on autods tanks so again you're opening
16:01:47
this little uh chat with them and this is where you will start building your relationship with your private suppliers
16:01:53
next we've got settings I already went through all the settings with you I just wanted to get you guys acquainted with the rest of the options and features
16:02:00
that you have here in autods if I scroll here on the top right we do have our manage order balance we've already been
16:02:06
through here and also the AI credits to build our titles and descriptions all with the help of artificial intelligence
16:02:12
next you've got your name right here so this is your account and here you also have the autods wallet so here is where
16:02:19
you can connect your Pioneer account to autods so if you're using Pioneer to pay for your orders or for any other reason
16:02:26
you can connect it right here with autods and this way you'll be able to see all of your pay in your accounts transactions you can load balance to
16:02:33
autods using this connected pay on your account and quite simply you won't need to log in manually to your pay on your
16:02:39
account outside because here inside you already have it and we can take a look right here where I have another one of
16:02:45
my accounts connected so here you can see that I have my pay your account and I can see the balance that I have right
16:02:50
here so I've got $834 in this account and these are all of the transactions that that happened with this account so
16:02:57
I can see all my C charges uh the payments that I'm getting so what's coming in what's going out and the total
16:03:03
funds that we can see here on the side and I can click right here withdraw to autods balance so that I can top up my
16:03:08
fulfilled by autods balance to be able to continue fulfilling my orders automatically and pay for the products
16:03:14
you can also connect multiple payer in your accounts so here I can click on this account I can click on the second one and then here I have another account
16:03:21
with about $220 and go on to your next so you can connect multiple paying your accounts and that will also help you top
16:03:26
up your balance and take further action so if you're working with Pioneer I highly suggest connecting it with your
16:03:33

16:04:01

16:04:20
right here so it's really easy to learn everything all from one place without having to pay any money for this
16:04:25
knowledge and remember that once you learn you also want to take action it's not enough
16:04:30
to just learn the fact that you made it this far in the video already shows that you already have what it takes to learn
16:04:36
to gather data to gather information and highly valued actionable steps
16:04:41
information that will actually help you succeed but that's only half the battle now the next half is to actually take
16:04:47
action okay so don't forget that one is as important as the other but anyways you have all of this Academy all of
16:04:52
these courses absolutely for free inside the autods AC Academy and last but not least you also have the help center and
16:04:58
The Help Center is especially helpful for making a feature request so here you're going to click on feature request
16:05:04
and if there's ever anything that you want to see in autods a certain feature a certain option you're going to see if
16:05:10
somebody already created a vote for that and if they did You're simply going to upclick it to upvote it and as you can
16:05:15
see here we have a whole bunch of people who are voting for things that they want to see in the system and this is how we
16:05:20
create our next new features so you can see a lot of votes inside uh something that has do with supplier changes or
16:05:27
supplier additions orders products drafts management and so forth and once we have enough votes we move it to the
16:05:33
plan section as you can see right here so we have a few plans up ahead like adding the bundling option when we're
16:05:39
importing products automatic balance top up in the fulfilled by autods service
16:05:44
and also adding fulfilled by autods for uh Facebook Marketplace and other ideas right here so all of this is planned and
16:05:51
our developers will start working on them then we have in progress so this is what the developers are currently working on and you have live so these
16:05:58
are the features that recently came out from these feature requests so using credit card for auto fulfillment Service
16:06:04

16:06:10
and others so we always listen to what you need for your business and that is
16:06:16

16:06:48
wonderful things that we have with autods the best automation software on the planet firm believer that I have
16:06:54
been personally using for several years now so now that we have the full overview of how to use autods and we
16:07:00
already understand how to launch our stores how to find winnable products to sell how to find the best suppliers how
16:07:05
to differentiate ourselves from the rest of the competition how to create organic social media accounts for organic
16:07:10
traffic how to create paid ads for Tik Tok and for Facebook how to fulfill our orders and how to do so many other
16:07:18
things in between now I'm ready to start scaling this store because we haven't scaled it so far and I want to turn this
16:07:25
into a big profit money making machine and that is going to be the next section that I will cover all right so the time
16:07:32
has come to finally conclude this video because it came out way longer than I initially intended but I got everything
16:07:38
that I wanted done I was able to create my Shopify store do my product research
16:07:44
connect with my suppliers connect with automation import my products optimize them in the best way that I know how
16:07:51
created the video ads for the products posted them on organic social media channels to see which videos are
16:07:57
performing well I took the best performing videos and put a budget on them in pay-per-click marketing and
16:08:03
there I was finally able to scale the first few ads the first few days of running ads usually doesn't give any
16:08:10
significant results but on the third day I was making sales on all of the ads
16:08:15
that I was running and after turning them off on the third day and I turned them on later to scale they finally were
16:08:22
able to make consistent sales and bring me into to the profit zone so I stopped
16:08:27
with the pet steam brush I focused more on the alarm door stopper or alert Guard Pro the way that I called it and it put
16:08:34
me in the profit Zone it's still making sales as I speak and I would like to show you guys how this store is
16:08:41
performing even after recording this video so if you want to see the continued results of this store let me
16:08:46

16:09:04
